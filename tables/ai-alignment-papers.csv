We’d really appreciate being corrected if so. [ETA: so far, no corrections.] TLDR: see the summary table. In the last few years, people have proposed various AI takeover scenarios. We think this type of scenario building is great, since there are now more concrete ideas of what AI takeover could realistically look like. That said, we have been confused for a while about how the different scenarios relate to each other and what different assumptions they make. This post might be helpful for anyone who has similar confusions. We focus on explaining the differences between seven prominent scenarios: the  ‘Brain-in-a-box’ scenario, ‘What failure looks like’ part 1 (WFLL 1), ‘What failure looks like’ part 2 (WFLL 2), ‘Another (outer) alignment failure story’  (AAFS), ‘Production Web’, ‘Flash economy’ and ‘Soft takeoff leading to decisive strategic advantage’. While these scenarios do not capture alI of the risks from transformative AI, participants in a recent survey aimed at leading AI safety/governance researchers estimated the first three of these scenarios to cover 50% of existential catastrophes from AI.[1] We plan to follow up with a subsequent post, which discusses some of the issues raised here in greater depth. VARIABLES RELATING TO AI TAKEOVER SCENARIOS We define AI takeover to be a scenario where the most consequential decisions about the future get made by AI systems with goals that aren’t desirable by human standards. There are three variables which are sufficient to distinguish the takeover scenarios discussed in this post. We will briefly introduce these three variables, and a number of others that are generally useful for thinking about takeover scenarios. Key variables for distinguishing the AI takeover scenarios in this post:  * Speed.

I look through the topics it learns, and find one corresponding to detective stories. The problem: I would like to use the identified detective-story cluster to generate detective stories from GPT. The hard part: I would like to do this in such a way that the precision of the notion of detective-stories used by the final system is not limited by the original simple model. Here’s what that means, visually. The space of real-world books has some clusters in it: One of those clusters is the detective-story cluster. The simple model approximates those clusters using something simple - for the sake of visualization, ellipses: The more complex model (e.g. GPT) presumably has a much more precise approximation of the shape of the clusters: So, we’d like to use the simple model to identify one of the clusters, but then still use the full power of the complex model to sample from that cluster. Of course, GPT may not contain a single variable corresponding to a cluster-id, which is largely what makes the problem interesting. GPT may not internally use a notion of “cluster” at all. However, the GPT model should still contain something (approximately) isomorphic to the original cluster, since that real pattern is still in the data/environment: since there is a real cluster of ""detective stories"" in the data/environment itself, the GPT model should also contain that cluster, to the extent that the GPT model matches the data/environment. In particular, the “precision not limited by original model” requirement rules out the obvious strategy of generating random samples from GPT and selecting those which the simple model labels as detective-stories. If we do that, then we’ll end up with some non-detective-stories in the output, because of shortcomings in the simple model’s notion of detective-stories. Visually, we’d be filtering based on the ellipse approximation of the cluster, which is exac",2020-10-13,2022-01-30 4:48:47,2022-01-30 4:48:47,2021-11-08 23:30:38,,,,,,,Toy Problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/MWR5EK7V/toy-problem-detective-story-alignment.html,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary motivations for assembling this database were to:  1. Aid potential donors in assessing organizations focusing on TAI safety by     collecting and analyzing their research output.  2. Assemble a comprehensive bibliographic database that can be used as a base     for future projects, such as a living review of the field. The database contains research works motivated by, and substantively informing, the challenge of ensuring the safety of TAI, including both technical and meta topics. This initial version of the database has attempted comprehensive coverage only for traditionally formatted research produced in 2016-2020 by organizations with a significant safety focus (~360 items). The database also has significant but non-comprehensive coverage (~570 items) of earlier years, less traditional formats (e.g., blog posts), and non-safety-focused organizations. Usefully, we also have citation counts for essentially all the items for which that is applicable. The core database takes the form of a Zotero library. Snapshots are also available as Google Sheet, CSV, and Zotero RDF. (Compact version for easier human reading: Google Sheet, CSV.) The rest of this post describes the composition of the database in more detail and presents some high-level quantitative analysis of the contents. In particular, our analysis includes:  * Lists of the most cited TAI safety research for each of the past few years    (Tables 2 and 3)  * A chart showing how written TAI safety research output has changed since 2016    (Figure 1).  * A visualization of the degree of collaboration on TAI safety between    different research organizations (Table 4).  * A chart showing how the format of written research varied between    organizations, e.g., manuscripts vs. jou",2020-12-22,2022-01-30 4:48:47,2022-01-30 4:48:47,2021-11-13 14:31:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K3XMEA86,blogPost,2020,"Xu, Mark",The Solomonoff Prior is Malign,,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Tr7tAyt5zZpdTwTQK/the-solomonoff-prior-is-malign,"This argument came to my attention from this post by Paul Christiano. I also found this clarification helpful. I found these counter-arguments stimulating and have included some discussion of them. Very little of this content is original. My contributions consist of fleshing out arguments and constructing examples. Thank you to Beth Barnes and Thomas Kwa for helpful discussion and comments. WHAT IS THE SOLOMONOFF PRIOR? The Solomonoff prior is intended to answer the question ""what is the probability of X?"" for any X, where X is a finite string over some finite alphabet. The Solomonoff prior is defined by taking the set of all Turing machines (TMs) which output strings when run with no input and weighting them proportional to2−K, whereKis the description length of the TM (informally its size in bits). The Solomonoff prior says the probability of a string is the sum over all the weights of all TMs that print that string. One reason to care about the Solomonoff prior is that we can use it to do a form of idealized induction. If you have seen 0101 and want to predict the next bit, you can use the Solomonoff prior to get the probability of 01010 and 01011. Normalizing gives you the chances of seeing 1 versus 0, conditioned on seeing 0101. In general, any process that assigns probabilities to all strings in a consistent way can be used to do induction in this way. This post provides more information about Solomonoff Induction. WHY IS IT MALIGN? Imagine that you wrote a programming language called python^10 that works as follows: First, it takes all alpha-numeric chars that are not in literals and checks if they're repeated 10 times sequentially. If they're not, they get deleted. If they are, they get replaced by a single copy. Second, it runs this new program through a python interpreter. Hello world in python^10: ppppppppprrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnntttttttttt('Hello, world!') Luckily, python has an exec function that executes literals as code.

Wentworth, this is a reference for a technique I learned from Evan Hubinger. He's probably not the first to use it, but he introduced it to me, so he gets the credit. In a single sentence, backchaining to local search is the idea of looking at how a problem of alignment could appear through local search (think gradient descent). So it starts with a certain problem (say reward tampering), and then tries to create a context where the usual training process in ML (local search) could create a system suffering from this problem. It’s an instance of backchaining in general, which just looks for how a problem could appear in practice. Backchaining to local search has two main benefits:  * It helps decide whether this specific problem is something we should worry    about.  * It forces you to consider your problem from a local search perspective,    instead of the more intuitive human/adversarial perspective (how would I mess    this up?). Let's look at a concrete example: reward gaming (also called specification gaming). To be even more concrete, we have a system with a camera and other sensors, and its goal is to maximize the amount of time when my friend Tom smiles, as measured through a loss function that captures whether the camera sees Tom smiling. The obvious (for us) way to do reward gaming here is to put a picture of Tom’s smiling face in front of the camera -- then the loss function is minimized. The backchaining to local search technique applied to this example asks ""How can I get this reward gaming behavior by local search?"" Well this reward gaming strategy is probably a local minima for the loss function (as changing just a little the behavior would increase the loss significantly), so local search could find it and stay in there. It's also better than most simple strategies, as ensuring that someone smiles (not necessarily a good goal, mind you) requires rather complex actions in the world (like going full ""Joker"" on",2020-09-18,2022-01-30 4:48:47,2022-01-30 4:48:47,2021-11-07 22:33:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/74AE9R4X/the-backchaining-to-local-search-technique-in-ai-alignment.html,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

79Z4M7BF,blogPost,2020,"Turner, Alex",Non-Obstruction: A Simple Concept Motivating Corrigibility,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Xts5wm3akbemk4pDa/non-obstruction-a-simple-concept-motivating-corrigibility,"Thanks to Mathias Bonde, Tiffany Cai, Ryan Carey, Michael Cohen, Joe Collman, Andrew Critch, Abram Demski, Michael Dennis, Thomas Gilbert, Matthew Graves, Koen Holtman, Evan Hubinger, Victoria Krakovna, Amanda Ngo, Rohin Shah, Adam Shimi, Logan Smith, and Mark Xu for their thoughts. Main claim: corrigibility’s benefits can be mathematically represented as a counterfactual form of alignment. Overview: I’m going to talk about a unified mathematical frame I have for understanding corrigibility’s benefits, what it “is”, and what it isn’t. This frame is precisely understood by graphing the human overseer’s ability to achieve various goals (their attainable utility (AU) landscape). I argue that corrigibility’s benefits are secretly a form of counterfactual alignment (alignment with a set of goals the human may want to pursue). A counterfactually aligned agent doesn't have to let us literally correct it. Rather, this frame theoretically motivates why we might want corrigibility anyways. This frame also motivates other AI alignment subproblems, such as intent alignment, mild optimization, and low impact. NOMENCLATURE Corrigibility goes by a lot of concepts: “not incentivized to stop us from shutting it off”, “wants to account for its own flaws”, “doesn’t take away much power from us”, etc. Named by Robert Miles, the word ‘corrigibility’ means “able to be corrected [by humans]."" I’m going to argue that these are correlates of a key thing we plausibly actually want from the agent design, which seems conceptually simple. In this post, I take the following common-language definitions:  * Corrigibility: the AI literally lets us correct it (modify its policy), and    it doesn't manipulate us either. * Without both of these conditions, the AI's       behavior isn't sufficiently constrained for the concept to be useful.       Being able to correct it is small comfort if it manipulates us into making       the modifications it wants. An AI which is only non-manipulative doesn'",2020,2022-01-30 4:48:46,2022-01-30 4:48:46,2021-11-13 15:28:56,,,,,,,Non-Obstruction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/8IPMHT9D/non-obstruction-a-simple-concept-motivating-corrigibility.html,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OVERVIEW We introduce the concept of memetic downside risks (MDR): risks of unintended negative effects that arise from how ideas “evolve” over time (as a result of  replication, mutation, and selection). We discuss how this concept relates to the existing concepts of memetics, downside risks, and information hazards. We then outline four “directions” in which ideas may evolve: towards simplicity, salience, usefulness, and perceived usefulness. For each “direction”, we give an example to illustrate how an idea mutating in that direction could have negative effects. We then discuss some implications of these ideas for people and organisations trying to improve the world, who wish to achieve their altruistic objectives and minimise the unintended harms they cause. For example, we argue that the possibility of memetic downside risks increases the value of caution about what and how to communicate, and of “high-fidelity” methods of communication. BACKGROUND AND CONCEPT MEMETICS Wikipedia describes a meme as: an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture—often with the aim of conveying a particular phenomenon, theme, or meaning represented by the meme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. The same article goes on to say: Proponents [of the concept of memes] theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influences a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive,",2020-02-25,2022-01-30 4:48:46,2022-01-30 4:48:46,2021-11-20 19:01:44,,,,,,,Memetic downside risks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/X65UHRG3/memetic-downside-risks-how-ideas-can-evolve-and-cause-harm.html,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Confident denouncements by eminent scientists should certainly give us reason to be sceptical of a technology, but not to bet our lives against it - their track record just isn’t good enough for that. I strongly agree with those claims, think they’re very important in relation to  estimating existential risk,[1] and appreciate the nuanced way in which they’re stated. (There’s also a lot more nuance around this passage which I haven’t quoted.) I also largely agree with similar claims made in Eliezer Yudkowsky’s earlier essay There's No Fire Alarm for Artificial General Intelligence. But both Ord and Yudkowsky provide the same set of three specific historical cases as evidence of the poor track record of such “confident denouncements”. And I think those cases provide less clear evidence than those authors seem to suggest. So in this post, I’ll:  * Quote Ord and/or Yudkowsky’s descriptions of those three cases, as well as    one case mentioned by Yudkowsky but not Ord  * Highlight ways in which those cases may be murkier than Ord and Yudkowsky    suggest  * Discuss how much we could conclude about technology forecasting in general     from such a small and likely unrepresentative sample of cases, even if those    cases weren’t murky I should note that I don’t think that these historical cases are necessary to support claims like those Ord and Yudkowsky make. And I suspect there might be better evidence for those claims out there. But those cases were the main evidence Ord provided, and among the main evidence Yudkowsky provided. So those cases are being used as key planks supporting beliefs that are important to many EAs and longtermists. Thus, it seems healthy to prod at each suspicious plank on its own terms, and update incrementally.

This post highlights and analyses existing ideas more than proposing new ones. In The Precipice, Toby Ord writes: An existential catastrophe is the destruction of humanity’s longterm potential. An existential risk is a risk that threatens the destruction of humanity’s longterm potential. I’ve previously discussed some distinctions and nuances relevant to these concepts. This post will focus on:  * The idea that these concepts are really about the destruction of the     potential of humanity or its “descendants”; they're not necessarily solely    about human wellbeing, nor just Homo sapiens’ potential.  * The implications of that, including for how “bad” an existential catastrophe    might be THE POTENTIAL OF HUMANITY AND ITS “DESCENDANTS” When explaining his definitions, Ord writes: my focus on humanity in the definitions is not supposed to exclude considerations of the value of the environment, other animals, successors to  Homo sapiens, or creatures elsewhere in the cosmos. It is not that I think only humans count. Instead, it is that humans are the only beings we know of that are responsive to moral reasons and moral argument - the beings who can examine the world and decide to do what is best. If we fail, that upwards force, that capacity to push towards what is best or what is just, will vanish from the world. Our potential is a matter of what humanity can achieve through the combined actions of each and every human. The value of our actions will stem in part from what we do to and for humans, but it will depend on the effects of our actions on non-humans too. If we somehow give rise to new kinds of moral agents in the future, the term ‘humanity’ in my definition should be taken to include them. This makes two points clear:  1. An existential catastrophe is not solely about the destruction of the     potential for human welfare, flourishing, achievement, etc. Instead, it’s     about humanity’s potential",2020-04-27,2022-01-30 4:48:45,2022-01-30 4:48:45,2021-11-20 19:00:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/T2T8GF5K/are-existential-risks-just-about-humanity.html,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2020) (which describes the development of GPT-3) contains measurements of how 8 transformers of different sizes perform on several different benchmarks. In this post, I project how performance could improve for larger models, and give an overview of issues that may appear when scaling-up. Note that these benchmarks are for ‘downstream tasks’ that are different from the training task (which is to predict the next token); these extrapolations thus cannot be directly read off the scaling laws in OpenAI’s Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models (Kaplan et al., 2020) or Scaling Laws for Autoregressive Generative Modelling (Henighan et al., 2020). (If you don’t care about methodology or explanations, the final graphs are in  Comparisons and limits .) METHODOLOGY Brown et al. reports benchmark performance for 8 different model sizes. However, these models were not trained in a compute-optimal fashion. Instead, all models were trained on 300B tokens (one word is roughly 1.4 tokens), which is inefficiently much data. Since we’re interested in the best performance we can get for a given amount of compute, and these models weren’t compute-optimally trained, we cannot extrapolate these results on the basis of model-size. Instead, I fit a trend for how benchmark performance (measured in % accuracy) depends on the cross-entropy loss that the models get when predicting the next token on the validation set. I then use the scaling laws from Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models to extrapolate this loss. This is explained in the Appendix. PLOTTING AGAINST LOSS In order to get a sense of how GPT-3 performs on different types of tasks, I separately report few-shot progress on each of the 11 different categories discussed in Brown et al. For a fair comparison, I normalize the accuracy of each category between random performance and maximum performance; i.e., for each data point, I subtract the performance that a model would get if it responded randomly (or only respo",2020-12-18,2022-01-30 4:48:45,2022-01-30 4:48:45,2021-11-13 22:24:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/2EXQWDPT/extrapolating-gpt-n-performance.html,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
F4RGR6AR,blogPost,2020,"Harris, Edouard",Defining capability and alignment in gradient descent,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Xg2YycEfCnLYrCcjy/defining-capability-and-alignment-in-gradient-descent,"This is the first post in a series where I'll explore AI alignment in a simplified setting: a neural network that's being trained by gradient descent. I'm choosing this setting because it involves a well-defined optimization process that has enough complexity to be interesting, but that's still understandable enough to make crisp mathematical statements about. As a result, it serves as a good starting point for rigorous thinking about alignment. DEFINING INNER ALIGNMENT First, I want to highlight a definitional issue. Right now there are two definitions of inner alignment circulating in the community. This issue was first pointed out to me by Evan Hubinger in a recent conversation. The first definition is the one from last year's Risks from Learned Optimization paper, which Evan co-authored and which introduced the term. This paper defined the inner alignment problem as ""the problem of eliminating the base-mesa objective gap"" (Section 1.2). The implication is that if we can eliminate the gap between the base objective of a base optimizer, and the mesa-objectives of any mesa-optimizers that base optimizer may give rise to, then we will have satisfied the necessary and sufficient conditions for the base optimizer to be inner-aligned. There's also a second definition that seems to be more commonly used. This definition says that ""inner alignment fails when your capabilities generalize but your objective does not"". This comes from an intuition (pointed out to me by  Rohin Shah) that the combination of inner alignment and outer alignment should be accident-proof with respect to an optimizer's intent: an optimizer that's both inner- and outer-aligned should be trying to do what we want. Since an outer-aligned optimizer is one whose base objective is something we want, this intuition suggests that the remaining part of the intent alignment problem — the problem of getting the optimizer to try to achieve the base objective we set — is what inner alignment refers to.

Disclaimer: this post is less polished than my median. And my median post isn’t very polished to begin with. Imagine a large corporation - we’ll call it BigCo. BigCo knows that quality management is high-value, so they have a special program to choose new managers. They run the candidates through a program involving lots of management exercises, simulations, and tests, and select those who perform best. Of course, the exercises and simulations and tests are not a perfect proxy for the would-be managers’ real skills and habits. The rules can be gamed. Within a few years of starting the program, BigCo notices a drastic disconnect between performance in the program and performance in practice. The candidates who perform best in the program are those who game the rules, not those who manage well, so of course many candidates devote all their effort to gaming the rules. How should this problem be solved? Ancient Chinese scholars had a few competing schools of thought on this question, most notably the Confucianists and the Legalists. The (stylized) Confucianists’ answer was: the candidates should be virtuous and not abuse the rules. BigCo should demonstrate virtue and benevolence in general, and in return their workers should show loyalty and obedience. I’m not an expert, but as far as I can tell this is not a straw man - though stylized and adapted to a modern context, it accurately captures the spirit of Confucian thought. The (stylized) Legalists instead took the position obvious to any student of modern economics: this is an incentive design problem, and BigCo leadership should design less abusable incentives. If you have decent intuition for economics, it probably seems like the Legalist position is basically right and the Confucian position is Just Wrong. I don't want to discourage this intuition, but I expect that many people who have this intuitio",2020-11-02,2022-01-30 4:48:44,2022-01-30 4:48:44,2021-11-13 13:49:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/UPMVNDZV/confucianism-in-ai-alignment.html,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the talk, I present a somewhat critical take on how AI alignment has grown as a field, and how, from my perspective, it deserves considerably more philosophical and disciplinary diversity than it has enjoyed so far. I'm sharing it here in the hopes of generating discussion about the disciplinary and philosophical paradigms that (I understand) the AI alignment community to be rooted in, and whether or how we should move beyond them. Some sections cover introductory material that most people here are likely to be familiar with, so feel free to skip them. THE TALK Hey everyone, my name is Xuan (IPA: ɕɥɛn), and I’m doctoral student at MIT doing cognitive AI research. Specifically I work on how we can infer the hidden structure of human motivations by modeling humans using probabilistic programs. Today though I’ll be talking about something that’s more in the background that informs my work, and that’s about AI alignment, philosophical pluralism, and the relevance of non-Western philosophy. This talk will cover a lot of ground, so I want to give an overview to keep everyone oriented:  1. First, I’ll give a brief introduction to what AI alignment is, and why it     likely matters as an effective cause area.  2. I’ll then highlight some of the philosophical tendencies of current AI     alignment research, and argue that they reflect a relatively narrow set of     philosophical views.  3. Given that these philosophical views may miss crucial considerations, this     situation motivates the need for greater philosophical and disciplinary     pluralism.  4. And then as a kind of proof by example, I’ll aim to demonstrate how     non-Western philosophy might provide insight into several open problems in     AI alignment research.

INTRODUCTION As in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, I have attempted to review the research that has been produced by various organisations working on AI safety, to help potential donors gain a better understanding of the landscape. This is a similar role to that which GiveWell performs for global health charities, and somewhat similar to a securities analyst with regards to possible investments. My aim is basically to judge the output of each organisation in 2020 and compare it to their budget. This should give a sense of the organisations' average cost-effectiveness. We can also compare their financial reserves to their 2020 budgets to get a sense of urgency. I’d like to apologize in advance to everyone doing useful AI Safety work whose contributions I have overlooked or misconstrued. As ever I am painfully aware of the various corners I have had to cut due to time constraints from my job, as well as being distracted by 1) other projects, 2) the miracle of life and 3) computer games. This article focuses on AI risk work. If you think other causes are important too, your priorities might differ. This particularly affects GCRI, FHI and CSER, who both do a lot of work on other issues which I attempt to cover but only very cursorily.

Authors and Acknowledgements The researchers on this project were Elizabeth Barnes and Paul Christiano, with substantial help from William Saunders (who built the current web interface as well as other help), Joe Collman (who helped develop the structured debate mechanisms), and Mark Xu, Chris Painter, Mihnea Maftei and Ronny Fernandez (who took part in many debates as well as helping think through problems). We're also grateful to Geoffrey Irving and Evan Hubinger for feedback on drafts, and for helpful conversations, along with Richard Ngo, Daniel Ziegler, John Schulman, Amanda Askell and Jeff Wu. Finally, we're grateful to our contractors who participated in experiments, including Adam Scherlis, Kevin Liu, Rohan Kapoor and Kunal Sharda. WHAT WE DID We tested the debate protocol introduced in AI Safety via Debate with human judges and debaters. We found various problems and improved the mechanism to fix these issues (details of these are in the appendix). However, we discovered that a dishonest debater can often create arguments that have a fatal error, but where it is very hard to locate the error. We don’t have a fix for this “obfuscated argument” problem, and believe it might be an important quantitative limitation for both IDA and Debate. KEY TAKEAWAYS AND RELEVANCE FOR ALIGNMENT Our ultimate goal is to find a mechanism that allows us to learn anything that a machine learning model knows: if the model can efficiently find the correct answer to some problem, our mechanism should favor the correct answer while only requiring a tractable number of human judgements and a reasonable number of computation steps for the model.[1] We’re working under a hypothesis that there are broadly two ways to know things: via step-by-step reasoning about implications (logic, computation…), and by learning and generalizing from data (pattern matching, bayesian updating…).

V295HB6Q,blogPost,2020,"Demski, Abram",Recursive Quantilizers II,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/YNuJjRuxsWWzfvder/recursive-quantilizers-ii,"I originally introduced the recursive quantilizers idea here, but didn't provide a formal model until my recent Learning Normativity post. That formal model had some problems. I'll correct some of those problems here. My new model is closer to HCH+IDA, and so, is even closer to Paul Christiano style systems than my previous. However, I'm also beginning to suspect that quantilizers aren't the right starting point. I'll state several problems with quantilizers at the end of this post. First, let's reiterate the design criteria, and why the model in Learning Normativity wasn't great. CRITERIA Here are the criteria from Learning Normativity, with slight revisions. See the earlier post for further justifications/intuitions behind these criteria.  1. No Perfect Feedback: we want to be able to learn with the possibility that     any one piece of data is corrupt. 1. Uncertain Feedback: data can be given in an uncertain form, allowing         100% certain feedback to be given (if there ever is such a thing), but         also allowing the system to learn significant things in the absence of         any certainty.      2. Reinterpretable Feedback: ideally, we want rich hypotheses about the         meaning of feedback, which help the system to identify corrupt feedback,         and interpret the information in imperfect feedback. To this criterion,         I add two clarifying criteria: 1. Robust Listening: in some sense, we don't want the system to be able             to ""entirely ignore"" humans. If the system goes off-course, we want             to be able to correct that.          2. Arbitrary Reinterpretation: at the same time, we want the AI to be             able to entirely reinterpret feedback based on a rich model of what             humans mean. This criterion stands in tension with Robust Listening.             However, the proposal in the present post is, I think, a plausible             way to achieve both.                              2.

V9AHZ7MX,blogPost,2020,"Demski, Abram",Learning Normativity: A Research Agenda,,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/2JGu9yxiJkoGdQR4s/learning-normativity-a-research-agenda,"(Related to Inaccessible Information, Learning the Prior, and Better Priors as a Safety Problem. Builds on several of my alternate alignment ideas.) I want to talk about something which I'll call learning normativity. What is normativity? Normativity is correct behavior. I mean something related to the fuzzy concept humans convey with the word ""should"". I think it has several interesting features:  * Norms are the result of a complex negotiation between humans, so they    shouldn't necessarily be thought of as the result of maximizing some set of    values. This distinguishes learning normativity from value learning.  * A lot of information about norms is present in the empirical distribution of    what people actually do, but you can't learn norms just by learning human    behavior. This distinguishes it from imitation learning.  * It's often possible to provide a lot of information in the form of ""good/bad""    feedback. This feedback should be interpreted more like approval-directed    learning rather than RL. However, approval should not be treated as a gold    standard.  * Similarly, it's often possible to provide a lot of information in the form of    rules, but rules are not necessarily 100% true; they are just very likely to    apply in typical cases.  * In general, it's possible to get very rich types of feedback, but very sparse    : humans get all sorts of feedback, including not only instruction on how to    act, but also how to think.  * Any one piece of feedback is suspect. Teachers can make mistakes,    instructions can be wrong, demonstrations can be imperfect, dictionaries can    contain spelling errors, reward signals can be corrupt, and so on. EXAMPLE: LANGUAGE LEARNING A major motivating example for me is how language learning works in humans. There is clearly, to some degree, a ""right way"" and a ""wrong way"" to use a language. I'll call this correct usage. One notable feature of language learning is that we don't always speak, or write, in c",2020,2022-01-30 4:48:21,2022-01-30 4:48:21,2021-11-13 19:38:49,,,,,,,Learning Normativity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/ZWEX5GR8/learning-normativity-a-research-agenda.html,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
USEM8RBA,blogPost,2020,"Demski, Abram",Comparing Utilities,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/cYsGrWEzjb324Zpjx/comparing-utilities,"(This is a basic point about utility theory which many will already be familiar with. I draw some non-obvious conclusions which may be of interest to you even if you think you know this from the title -- but the main point is to communicate the basics. I'm posting it to the alignment forum because I've heard misunderstandings of this from some in the AI alignment research community.) I will first give the basic argument that the utility quantities of different agents aren't directly comparable, and a few important consequences of this. I'll then spend the rest of the post discussing what to do when you need to compare utility functions. UTILITIES AREN'T COMPARABLE. Utility isn't an ordinary quantity. A utility function is a device for expressing the preferences of an agent. Suppose we have a notion of outcome.* We could try to represent the agent's preferences between outcomes as an ordering relation: if we have outcomes A, B, and C, then one possible preference would be A<B<C. However, a mere ordering does not tell us how the agent would decide between  gambles, ie, situations giving A, B, and C with some probability. With just three outcomes, there is only one thing we need to know: is B closer to A or C, and by how much? We want to construct a utility function U() which represents the preferences. Let's say we set U(A)=0 and U(C)=1. Then we can represent B=G as U(B)=1/2. If not, we would look for a different gamble which does equal B, and then set B's utility to the expected value of that gamble. By assigning real-numbered values to each outcome, we can fully represent an agent's preferences over gambles. (Assuming the VNM axioms hold, that is.) But the initial choices U(A)=0 and U(C)=1 were arbitrary! We could have chosen any numbers so long as U(A)<U(C), reflecting the preference A<C. In general, a valid representation of our preferences U() can be modified into an equally valid U'() by adding/subtracting arbitrary numbers, or multiplying/dividing by pos",2020,2022-01-30 4:48:21,2022-01-30 4:48:21,2021-11-07 22:08:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/THUBZR6E/comparing-utilities.html,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He decided to disobey orders and not pass on the message to higher command, which could easily have resulted in a nuclear war (since the soviet nuclear position was ""launch on warning""). Now, did Petrov have free will when he decided to save the world? MAINTAINING FREE WILL WHEN KNOWLEDGE INCREASES I don't intend to go into the subtle philosophical debate on the nature of free will. See this post for a good reductionist account. Instead, consider the following scenarios:  1. The standard Petrov incident.  2. The standard Petrov incident, except that it is still ongoing and Petrov     hasn't reached a decision yet.  3. The standard Petrov incident, after it was over, except that we don't yet     know what his final decision was.  4. The standard Petrov incident, except that we know that, if Petrov had had     eggs that morning (instead of porridge[1]), he would have made a different     decision.  5. The same as scenario 4., except that some entity deliberately gave Petrov     porridge that morning, aiming to determine his decision.  6. The standard Petrov incident, except that a guy with a gun held Petrov     hostage and forced him not to pass on the report. There is an interesting contrast between scenarios 1, 2, and 3. Clearly, 1 and 3 only differ in our knowledge of the incident. It does not seem that Petrov's free will should depend on the degree of knowledge of some other person. Scenarios 1 and 2 only differ in time: in one case the decision is made, in the second it is yet to be made.

I believe advances in AI are likely to be among the most impactful global developments in the coming decades, and that AI governance will become among the most important global issue areas. AI governance is a new field and is relatively neglected. I’ll explain here how I think about this as a cause area and my perspective on how best to pursue positive impact in this space. The value of investing in this field can be appreciated whether one is primarily concerned with contemporary policy challenges or long-term risks and opportunities (“longtermism”); this piece is primarily aimed at a longtermist  perspective. Differing from some other longtermist work on AI, I emphasize the importance of also preparing for more conventional scenarios of AI development. CONTEMPORARY POLICY CHALLENGES AI systems are increasingly being deployed in important domains: for many kinds of surveillance; by authoritarian governments to shape online discourse; for autonomous weapons systems; for cyber tools and autonomous cyber capabilities; to aid and make consequential decisions such as for employment, loans, and criminal sentencing; in advertising; in education and testing; in self-driving cars and navigation; in social media.

In other words, it is trying to infer the criteria by which we judge situations to be good. This is particularly hard because in novel situations that humans haven't seen yet, we haven't even developed the criteria by which we would evaluate. (This is one of the reasons why we need to model humans as suboptimal, which causes problems.) Instead of this, we can use narrow value learning, which produces behavior that we want in some narrow domain, without expecting generalization to novel circumstances. The simplest form of this is imitation learning, where the AI system simply tries to imitate the supervisor's behavior. This limits the AI’s performance to that of its supervisor. We could also learn from preferences over behavior, which can scale to superhuman performance, since the supervisor can often evaluate whether a particular behavior meets our preferences even if she can’t perform it herself. We could also teach our AI systems to perform tasks that we would not want to do ourselves, such as handling hot objects. Nearly all of the work on preference learning, including most work on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), is aimed at narrow value learning. IRL is often explicitly stated to be a technique for imitation learning, and early algorithms phrase the problem as matching the features in the demonstration, not exceeding them. The few algorithms that try to generalize to different test distributions, such as AIRL, are only aiming for relatively small amounts of generalization. (Why use IRL instead of behavioral cloning, where you mimic the actions that the demonstrator took? The hope is that IRL gives you a good inductive bias for imitation, allowing you to be more sample efficient and to generalize a little bit.)

I italicize “defining” to emphasize that this is  not the problem of actually computing behavior that we want to see -- that’s the full AI safety problem. Here we are allowed to use hopelessly impractical schemes, as long as the resulting definition would allow us to in theory compute the behavior that an AI system would take, perhaps with assumptions like infinite computing power or arbitrarily many queries to a human. (Although we do prefer specifications that seem like they could admit an efficient implementation.) In terms of DeepMind’s classification, we are looking for a design specification that exactly matches the ideal specification. HCH and  indirect normativity are examples of attempts at such specifications. We will consider a model in which our AI system is maximizing the expected utility of some explicitly represented utility function that can depend on history. (It does not matter materially whether we consider utility functions or reward functions, as long as they can depend on history.) The utility function may be learned from data, or designed by hand, but it must be an explicit part of the AI that is then maximized. I will not justify this model for now, but simply assume it by fiat and see where it takes us. I’ll note briefly that this model is often justified by the  VNM utility theorem and AIXI, and as the natural idealization of reinforcement learning, which aims to maximize the expected sum of rewards, although typically rewards in RL depend only on states. A lot of conceptual arguments, as well as experiences with specification gaming, suggest that we are unlikely to be able to simply think hard and write down a good specification, since even small errors in specifications can lead to bad results.

Previously: Worrying about the Vase: Whitelisting, Overcoming Clinginess in Impact Measures, Impact Measure Desiderata To be used inside an advanced agent, an impact measure... must capture so much variance that there is no clever strategy whereby an advanced agent can produce some special type of variance that evades the measure. ~ Safe Impact MeasureIf we have a safe impact measure, we may have arbitrarily-intelligent unaligned agents which do small (bad) things instead of big (bad) things.  For the abridged experience, read up to ""Notation"", skip to ""Experimental Results"", and then to ""Desiderata"". WHAT IS ""IMPACT""? One lazy Sunday afternoon, I worried that I had written myself out of a job. After all, Overcoming Clinginess in Impact Measures basically said, ""Suppose an impact measure extracts 'effects on the world'. If the agent penalizes itself for these effects, it's incentivized to stop the environment (and any agents in it) from producing them. On the other hand, if it can somehow model other agents and avoid penalizing their effects, the agent is now incentivized to get the other agents to do its dirty work."" This seemed to be strong evidence against the possibility of a simple conceptual core underlying ""impact"", and I didn't know what to do. At this point, it sometimes makes sense to step back and try to say exactly what you don't know how to solve – try to crisply state what it is that you want an unbounded solution for. Sometimes you can't even do that much, and then you may actually have to spend some time thinking 'philosophically' – the sort of stage where you talk to yourself about some mysterious ideal quantity of [chess] move-goodness and you try to pin down what its properties might be. ~  Methodology of Unbounded Anal",2018,2022-01-30 4:51:11,2022-01-30 4:51:11,2020-12-13 23:51:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far we’ve looked at the notion that the AI system should get feedback from the user and that it could use reward uncertainty for corrigibility. These are focused on the AI system, but what about the human? If we build a system that explicitly solicits feedback from the human, what do we have to say about the human policy, and how the human should provide feedback? INTERPRETING HUMAN ACTIONS One major free variable in any explicit interaction or feedback mechanism is what semantics the AI system should attach to the human feedback. The classic examples of AI risk are usually described in a way where this is the problem: when we provide a reward function that rewards paperclips, the AI system interprets it literally and maximizes paperclips, rather than interpreting it pragmatically as another human would. (Aside: I suspect this was not the original point of the paperclip maximizer, but it has become a very popular retelling, so I’m using it anyway.) Modeling this classic example as a human-AI system, we can see that the problem is that the human is offering a form of “feedback”, the reward function, and the AI system is not ascribing the correct semantics to it. The way it uses the reward function implies that the reward function encodes the optimal behavior of the AI system in all possible environments -- a moment’s thought is sufficient to see that this is not actually the case. There will definitely be many cases and environments that the human did not consider when designing the reward function, and we should not expect that the reward function incentivizes the right behavior in those cases. So what can the AI system assume if the human provides it a reward function?  Inverse Reward Design (IRD) offers one answer: the human is likely to provide a particular reward function if it leads to high true utility behavior in the training environment.

By research areas I mean “AI research topics that already have groups of people working on them and writing up their results”, as opposed to research “directions” in which I’d like to see these areas “move”.

My hope is that my assessments in this post can be helpful to students and established AI researchers who are thinking about shifting into new research areas specifically with the goal of contributing to existential safety somehow. In these assessments, I find it important to distinguish between the following types of value:  * The helpfulness of the area to existential safety, which I think of as a    function of what services are likely to be provided as a result of research    contributions to the area, and whether those services will be helpful to    existential safety, versus  * The educational value of the area for thinking about existential safety,    which I think of as a function of how much a researcher motivated by    existential safety might become more effective through the process of    familiarizing with or contributing to that area, usually by focusing on ways    the area could be used in service of existential safety.  * The neglect of the area at various times, which is a function of how much    technical progress has been made in the area relative to how much I think is    needed. Importantly:  * The helpfulness to existential safety scores do not assume that your    contributions to this area would be used only for projects with existential    safety as their mission.

XH9E33N4,blogPost,2019,"Shah, Rohin",Reward uncertainty,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ZiLLxaLB5CCofrzPp/reward-uncertainty,"In my last post, I argued that interaction between the human and the AI system was necessary in order for the AI system to “stay on track” as we encounter new and unforeseen changes to the environment. The most obvious implementation of this would be to have an AI system that keeps an estimate of the reward function. It acts to maximize its current estimate of the reward function, while simultaneously updating the reward through human feedback. However, this approach has significant problems. Looking at the description of this approach, one thing that stands out is that the actions are chosen according to a reward that we know is going to change. (This is what leads to the incentive to disable the narrow value learning system.) This seems clearly wrong: surely our plans should account for the fact that our rewards will change, without treating such a change as adversarial? This suggests that we need to have our action selection mechanism take the future rewards into account as well. While we don’t know what the future reward will be, we can certainly have a  probability distribution over it. So what if we had uncertainty over reward functions, and took that uncertainty into account while choosing actions? SETUP We’ve drilled down on the problem sufficiently far that we can create a formal model and see what happens. So, let’s consider the following setup:  * The human, Alice, knows the “true” reward function that she would like to    have optimized.  * The AI system maintains a probability distribution over reward functions, and    acts to maximize the expected sum of rewards under this distribution.  * Alice and the AI system take turns acting. Alice knows that the AI learns    from her actions, and chooses actions accordingly.  * Alice’s action space is such that she cannot take the action “tell the AI    system the true reward function” (otherwise the problem would become    trivial).  * Given these assumptions, Alice and the AI system act optimally.

Making better plans is the convergent instrumental goal, of which all familiar convergent instrumental goals are an instance. This is key to understanding what agency is and why it is powerful. Planning means using a world model to predict the consequences of various courses of actions one could take, and taking actions that have good predicted consequences. (We think of this with the handle “doing things for reasons,” though we acknowledge this may be an idiosyncratic use of “reasons.”) We take “planning” to include things that are relevantly similar to this procedure, such as following a bag of heuristics that approximates it. We’re also including actually following the plans, in what might more clunkily be called “planning-acting.” Planning, in this broad sense, seems essential to the kind of goal-directed, consequential, agent-like intelligence that we expect to be highly impactful. This sequence explains why. ONE CONVERGENT INSTRUMENTAL GOAL TO RULE THEM ALL Consider the maxim “make there be more and/or better planning towards your goal.” This section argues that all the classic convergent instrumental goals are special cases of this maxim. To flesh this out a little, here are some categories of ways to follow the maxim. Remember that a planner is typically close (in terms of what it might affect via action) to at least one planner – itself – so these directions can typically be applied in the first case to the planner itself.  * Make the planners with your goal better at planning. For example, get them    new relevant data to work with¹, get them to run faster or more effective    algorithms, build protections against value drift, etc.  * Make the planners with your goal have better options. For example, move them    to better locations, get them more resources, get them more power or a    greater number of options to select from, have them take steps in an    object-level plan towards t",2021-10-24,2022-01-30 4:51:08,2022-01-30 4:51:08,2021-12-11 14:17:29,,,,,,,P₂B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/QRHZCPVT/p-b-plan-to-p-b-better.html,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most notably, I believe that Smoking lesion-type problems don't refute EDT. I also don't think that EDT's non-updatelessness leaves a lot of room for disagreement, given that EDT  recommends immediate self-modification to updatelessness. However, I do believe there are some issues with run-of-the-mill EDT. One of them is naturalized induction. It is in fact not only a problem for EDT but also for causal decision theory (CDT) and most other decision theories that have been proposed in- and outside of academia. It does not affect logical decision theories, however. THE ROLE OF NATURALIZED INDUCTION IN DECISION THEORY Recall that EDT prescribes taking the action that maximizes expected utility, i.e. where is the set of available actions, is the agent's utility function, is a set of possible world models, represents the agent's past observations (which may include information the agent has collected about itself). CDT works in a – for the purpose of this article – similar way, except that instead of conditioning on in the usual way, it calculates some causal counterfactual, such as Pearl's do-calculus: . The problem of naturalized induction is that of assigning posterior probabilities to world models (or or whatever) when the agent is  naturalized, i.e., embedded into its environment. Consider the following example. Let's say there are 5 world models , each of which has equal prior probability. These world models may be cellular automata. Now, the agent makes the observation . It turns out that worlds and don't contain any agents at all, and contains no agent making the observation . The other two world models, on the other hand, are consistent with . Thus, for and  for . Let's assume that the agent has only two actions and that in world model  the only agent making observation takes action and in the only agent making observation takes action , then a",2017-09-22,2022-01-30 4:51:08,2022-01-30 4:51:08,2020-11-23 0:47:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/PFXHQPWU/naturalized-induction-a-challenge-for-evidential-and-causal.html,,CLR; TechSafety; AmbiguosSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a post I wrote about Caspar Oesterheld’s long paper Multiverse-wide cooperation via correlated decision-making. Because I have found the idea tricky to explain – which unfortunately makes it difficult to get feedback from others on whether the thinking behind it makes sense – I decided to write a shorter summary. While I am hoping that my text can serve as a standalone piece, for additional introductory content I also recommend reading the beginning of Caspar’s paper, or watching the short video introduction here (requires basic knowledge of the “CDT, EDT or something else” debate in decision theory). 0. ELEVATOR PITCH (Disclaimer: Especially for the elevator pitch section here, I am sacrificing accuracy and precision for brevity. References can be found in Caspar’s paper.)  It would be an uncanny coincidence if the observable universe made up everything that exists. The reason we cannot find any evidence for there being stuff beyond the edges of our universe is not because it is likely that there is nothingness, but because photons from further away simply would not have had sufficient time after the big bang to reach us. This means that the universe we find ourselves in may well be vastly larger than what we can observe, in fact even infinitely  larger. The theory of inflationary cosmology in addition hints at the existence of other universe bubbles with different fundamental constants forming or disappearing under certain conditions, somehow co-existing with our universe in parallel. The umbrella term multiverse captures the idea that the observable universe is just a tiny portion of everything that exists. The multiverse may contain myriads of worlds like ours, including other worlds with intelligent life and civilization. An infinite multiverse (of one sort or another) is actually amongst the most popular cosmological hypotheses, arguably even favored by the majority of experts.

Now, before I go any further, let me be the first to say that I don’t think we should use this model to predict TAI. This model takes a very broad outside view and is thus inferior to models like Ajeya Cotra’s which make use of more relevant information. (However, it is still useful for rebutting claims that TAI is unprecedented, inconsistent with historical trends, low-prior, etc.) Nevertheless, out of curiosity I thought I’d calculate what the model implies for TAI timelines. Here is the projection made by Roodman’s model. The red line is real historic GWP data; the splay of grey shades that continues it is the splay of possible futures calculated by the model. The median trajectory is the black line. I messed around with a ruler to make some rough calculations, marking up the image with blue lines as I went. The big blue line indicates the point on the median trajectory where GWP is 10x what is was in 2019. Eyeballing it, it looks like it happens around 2040, give or take a year. The small vertical blue line indicates the year 2037. The small horizontal blue line indicates GWP in 2037 on the median trajectory. Thus, it seems that between 2037 and 2040 on the median trajectory, GWP doubles. (One-ninth the distance between 1,000 and 1,000,000 is crossed, which is one-third of an order of magnitude, which is about one doubling). This means that TAI happens around 2037 on the median trajectory according to this model, at least according to Ajeya Cotra’s definition of transformative AI  as “software which causes a tenfold acceleration in the rate of growth of the world economy (assuming that it is used everywhere that it would be economically profitable to use it)... This means that if TAI is developed in year Y, the entire world economy would more than double by year Y + 4.” What about the non-median trajectories? Each shade of grey represents 5 percent of the simulated future trajectories, so",2020,2022-01-30 4:51:08,2022-01-30 4:51:08,2020-12-12 15:02:13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/G7VN452V/how-roodman-s-gwp-model-translates-to-tai-timelines.html,,CLR; MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This preface will also be revised significantly once the second half of the sequence is fully written. PURPOSE OF THE SEQUENCE The first part of this sequence will be about the tractability of ambitious value learning, which is the idea of inferring a utility function for an AI system to optimize based on observing human behavior. After a short break, we will (hopefully) continue with the second part, which will be about why we might want to think about techniques that infer human preferences, even if we assume we won’t do ambitious value learning with such techniques. The aim of this part of the sequence is to gather the current best public writings on the topic, and provide a unifying narrative that ties them into a cohesive whole. This makes the key ideas more discoverable and discussable, and provides a quick reference for existing researchers. It is meant to teach the ideas surrounding one specific approach to aligning advanced AI systems. We’ll explore the specification problem, in which we would like to define the behavior we want to see from an AI system. Ambitious value learning is one potential avenue of attack on the specification problem, that assumes a particular model of an AI system (maximizing expected utility) and a particular source of data (human behavior). We will then delve into conceptual work on ambitious value learning that has revealed obstructions to this approach. There will be pointers to current research that aims to circumvent these obstructions. The second part of this sequence is currently being assembled, and this preface will be updated with details once it is ready. The first half of this sequence takes you near the cutting edge of conceptual  work on the ambitious value learning problem, with some pointers to work being done at this frontier. Based on the arguments in the sequence, I am confident that the obvious f",2018,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2020-12-17 4:36:13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/2HGSWMFH/oH8KMnXHnw964QyS6.html,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By ‘fun’ I mean ‘powerful.’ This hypothetical is highly relevant to AI timelines, for reasons I’ll explain later. Summary (Spoilers): I describe a hypothetical scenario that concretizes the question “what could be built with 2020’s algorithms/ideas/etc. but a trillion times more compute?”Then I give some answers to that question. Then I ask: How likely is it that some sort of TAI would happen in this scenario? This second question is a useful operationalization of the (IMO) most important, most-commonly-discussed timelines crux: “Can we get TAI just by throwing more compute at the problem?” I consider this operationalization to be the main contribution of this post; it directly plugs into Ajeya’s timelines model and is quantitatively more cruxy than anything else I know of. The secondary contribution of this post is my set of answers to the first question: They serve as intuition pumps for my answer to the second, which strongly supports my views on timelines. THE HYPOTHETICAL In 2016 the Compute Fairy visits Earth and bestows a blessing: Computers are magically 12 orders of magnitude faster! Over the next five years, what happens? The Deep Learning AI Boom still happens, only much crazier: Instead of making AlphaStar for 10^23 floating point operations, DeepMind makes something for 10^35. Instead of making GPT-3 for 10^23 FLOPs, OpenAI makes something for 10^35. Instead of industry and academia making a cornucopia of things for 10^20 FLOPs or so, they make a cornucopia of things for 10^32 FLOPs or so. When random grad students and hackers spin up neural nets on their laptops, they have a trillion times more compute to work with.

This post is about some problems facing this effort and some possible solutions. To explain these problems, I'll take the view that the agents deployed by AI developers (the ''principals'') in a multipolar scenario are moves in a game. The payoffs to a principal in this game depend on how the agents behave over time. We can talk about the equilibria of this game, and so on. Ideally, we would be able to make guarantees like this:  1. The payoffs resulting from the deployed agents' actions are optimal with     respect to some appropriate ""welfare function''. This welfare function would     encode some combination of total utility, fairness, and other social     desiderata;  2. The agents are in equilibrium --- that is, no principal has an incentive to     deploy an agent with a different design, given the agents deployed by the     other principals. The motivation for item 1 is clear: we want outcomes which are fair by each of the principals' lights. In particular, we want an outcome that the principals will all agree to. And item 2 is desirable because an equilibrium constitutes a self-enforcing contract; each agent wants to play their equilibrium strategy, if they believe that the other agents are playing the same equilibrium. Thus, given that the principals all say that they will deploy agents that satisfy 1 and 2, we could have some confidence that a welfare-optimal outcome will in fact obtain. Two simple but critical problems need to be addressed in order to make such guarantees: the equilibrium and prior selection problems. The equilibrium selection problem is that this deployment game will have many equilibria. Even if the principals agree on a welfare function, it is possible that many different profiles of agents optimize the same welfare function. So the principals need to coordinate on the profile of agents dep",2020,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2020-12-12 14:54:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/HV7EIWIV/equilibrium-and-prior-selection-problems-in-multipolar-1.html,,CLR; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This overview focuses on beliefs about population ethics and exchange rates between goods (e.g. happiness) and bads  (e.g. suffering). Two variables seem particularly important and action-guiding in this context, especially when trying to make informed choices about how to best shape the long-term future: 1) One’s normative goods-to-bads ratio  (N-ratio) and 2) one’s expected bads-to-goods ratio (E-ratio). I elaborate on how a framework consisting of these two variables could inform our decision-making with respect to shaping the long-term future, as well as facilitate cooperation among differing value systems and further moral reflection. I then present concrete ideas for further research in this area and investigate associated challenges. The last section lists resources which discuss further methodological and theoretical issues which were beyond the scope of the present text.

Again, Greaves & MacAskill: “Should we be more concerned about avoiding the worst possible outcomes for the future than we are for ensuring the very best outcomes occur [...]?” Given the enormous stakes, these are arguably some of the most important questions facing those who prioritize shaping the long-term future.1 Some interventions increase both the quality of future civilization as w",2018-04-03,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2020-11-23 0:40:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/K9FMSZDC/descriptive-population-ethics-and-its-relevance-for-cause.html,,CLR; MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We currently believe that:  * Several agential s-risks — in which agents deliberately cause great amounts    of suffering — are among the largest s-risks in expectation.  * One of the most promising ways of addressing these risks involves intervening    in the design of TAI systems to make them more cooperative.  * Increasing the cooperativeness of powerful systems is robustly valuable for    everybody interested in shaping the long-run future. (See the recent     Cooperative AI and AI Research Considerations for Existential Safety (ARCHES)     research agendas for examples of work motivated by considerations other than    s-risks.) This was the subject of our research agenda on cooperative, conflict, and TAI. In this post, I’d like to give an overview of some of the research that CLR has been doing on multi-agent systems. I’ll then briefly remark on the importance, tractability, and neglectedness of this work (both from a downside-focused and more mainstream longtermist perspective), though a thorough discussion of prioritization is beyond the scope of this post.

Introducing yet another medical Newcomb problem,LessWrong,,,,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iqpizeN4hkbTjkugo/did-edt-get-it-right-all-along-introducing-yet-another,"One of the main arguments given against Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) is that it would “one-box” in medical Newcomb problems. Whether this is the winning action has been a hotly debated issue on LessWrong. A majority, including experts in the area such as Eliezer Yudkowsky and Wei Dai, seem to think that one should two-box (See e.g. Yudkowsky 2010, p.67). Others have tried to argue  in favor of EDT by claiming that the winning action would be to one-box, or by offering reasons why EDT would in some cases two-box after all. In this blog post, I want to argue that EDT gets it right: one-boxing is the correct action in medical Newcomb problems. I introduce a new thought experiment, the Coin Flip Creation problem, in which I believe the winning move is to one-box. This new problem is structurally similar to other medical Newcomb problems such as the  Smoking Lesion, though it might elicit the intuition to one-box even in people who would two-box in some of the other problems. I discuss both how EDT and other decision theories would reason in the problem and why people’s intuitions might diverge in different formulations of medical Newcomb problems. TWO KINDS OF NEWCOMBLIKE PROBLEMS There are two different kinds of Newcomblike problems. In Newcomb’s original paradox, both EDT and Logical Decision Theories (LDT), such as Timeless Decision Theory (TDT) would one-box and therefore, unlike CDT, win $1 million. In medical Newcomb problems, EDT’s and LDT’s decisions diverge. This is because in the latter, a (physical) causal node that isn’t itself a decision algorithm influences both the current world state and our decisions – resulting in a correlation between action and environment but, unlike the original Newcomb, no “logical” causation. It’s often unclear exactly how a causal node can exert influence on our decisions. Does it change our decision theory, utility function, or the information available to us? In the case of the Smoking Lesion problem, it seems plausible",2017-01-24,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2020-11-23 0:55:10,,,,,,,Did EDT get it right all along?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/EJ9I6KHN/did-edt-get-it-right-all-along-introducing-yet-another.html,,CLR; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This post builds a taxonomy of the commitment mechanisms that transformative AI (TAI) systems could use in future multipolar scenarios, describes various issues they have in practice, and draws some tentative conclusions about the landscape of commitments we might expect in the future. INTRODUCTION A better understanding of the commitments that future AI systems could make is helpful for predicting and influencing the dynamics of multipolar scenarios. The option to credibly bind oneself to certain actions or strategies fundamentally changes the game theory behind bargaining, cooperation, and conflict. Credible commitments and general transparency can work to stabilize positive-sum agreements, and to increase the efficiency of threats (Schelling 1960), both of which could be relevant to how well TAI trajectories will reflect our values. Because human goals can be contradictory, and even broadly aligned AI systems could come to prioritize different outcomes depending on their domains and histories, these systems could end up in competitive situations and bargaining failures where a lot of value is lost. Similarly, if some systems in a multipolar scenario are well aligned and others less so, some worst cases might be avoidable if stable peaceful agreements can be reached. As an example of the practical significance of commitment ability in stabilizing peaceful strategies, standard theories in international relations hold that conflicts between nations are difficult to avoid indefinitely primarily because there are no reliable commitment mechanisms for peaceful agreements (e.g. Powell 2004, Lake 1999, Rosato 2015), even when nations would overall prefer them. In addition to the direct costs of conflict, the lack of enforceable commitments leads to continuous resource loss from arms races, monitoring, and other preparations for possible",2020,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2020-12-12 15:04:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/WFUHVWSK/commitment-and-credibility-in-multipolar-ai-scenarios.html,,CLR; MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is true in the sense that, for a given game-theoretic model of a strategic interaction, there is often some equilibrium in which all agents are better off than the conflict outcome. But real-world agents may not make decisions according to game-theoretic models, and when they do, they may use different models. This makes it more difficult to guarantee that real-world agents will avoid bargaining failure than is suggested by the observation that conflict is often inefficient.   In another post, I described the ""prior selection problem"", on which different agents having different models of their situation can lead to bargaining failure.

This post outlines my thinking on cause prioritization from the perspective of value systems whose primary concern is reducing disvalue. I’m mainly thinking of  suffering-focused ethics (SFE), but I also want to include moral views that attribute substantial disvalue to things other than suffering, such as inequality or preference violation. I will limit the discussion to interventions targeted at improving the long-term future (see the reasons in section II). I hope my post will also be informative for people who do not share a downside-focused outlook, as thinking about cause prioritization from different perspectives, with emphasis on considerations other than those one is used to, can be illuminating. Moreover, understanding the strategic considerations for plausible moral views is essential for acting under moral uncertainty and cooperating with people with other values. I will talk about the following topics:  * Which views qualify as downside-focused (given our empirical situation)  * Why downside-focused views prioritize s-risk reduction over utopia creation  * Why extinction risk reduction is unlikely to be a promising intervention    according to downside-focused views  * Why AI alignment is probably positive for downside-focused views, and    especially positive if done with certain precautions  * What to include in an EA portfolio that incorporates population ethical    uncertainty and cooperation between value systems WHICH VIEWS QUALIFY AS DOWNSIDE-FOCUSED? I’m using the term downside-focused to refer to value systems that in practice (given what we know about the world) primarily recommend working on interventions that make bad things less likely.[1] For example, if one holds that what is most important is how things turn out for individuals (welfarist consequentialism), and that it is comparatively unimportant to add well-off beings to the world, then one should likely focus on preventing suffering.[2] That would b",2018-01-31,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2020-11-23 0:44:01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/DI58FZJA/cause-prioritization-for-downside-focused-value-systems.html,,CLR; MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though the findings aren't particularly insightful, I’m posting this unpolished version to:  * Hopefully help other people attempting similar projects save time and effort  * Demonstrate one approach to case study selection  * Give others a sense of what one type of AI governance summer research project    might look like. SUMMARY  * Self-governance occurs when private actors coordinate to address issues that    are not obviously related to profit, with minimal involvement from    governments and standards bodies.  * Historical cases of self-governance to reduce technology risk are rare. I    find 6 cases that seem somewhat similar to AI development, including the    actions of Leo Szilard and other physicists in 1939 and the 1975 Asilomar    conference.  * The following factors seem to make self-governance efforts more likely to    occur: * Risks are salient     * The government looks like it might step in if private actors do       nothing     * The field or industry is small     * Support from gatekeepers (like journals and large consumer-facing       firms)     * Support from credentialed scientists.          * After the initial self-governance effort, governments usually step in to    develop and codify rules.  * My biggest takeaway is probably that self-governance efforts seem more likely    to occur when risks are somewhat prominent. As a result, we could do more to     connect “near-term” issues like data privacy and algorithmic bias with    “long-term” concerns. We could try to preemptively identify “fire alarms” for    TAI, and be ready to take advantage of these warning signals if they occur.

Several companies have released their own guidelines, and the Partnership on AI is a notable actor in the space.[1] In other words, we are beginning to see elements of self-governance in the AI industry",2021-04-06,2022-01-30 4:51:06,2022-01-30 4:51:06,2021-11-14 19:00:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/SHI8RDJ9/case-studies-of-self-governance-to-reduce-technology-risk.html,,MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a sentence, my argument is that the complexity and mysteriousness and efficiency of the human brain (compared to artificial neural nets) is almost zero evidence that building TAI will be difficult, because evolution typically makes things complex and mysterious and efficient, even when there are simple, easily understood, inefficient designs that work almost as well (or even better!) for human purposes. In slogan form: If all we had to do to get TAI was make a simple neural net 10x the size of my brain, my brain would still look the way it does. The case of birds & planes illustrates this point nicely. Moreover, it is also a precedent for several other short-timelines talking points, such as the human-brain-human-lifetime (HBHL) anchor. PLAN:  1. Illustrative Analogy  2. Exciting Graph  3. Analysis 1. Extra brute force can make the problem a lot easier      2.

To state this question more clearly, let’s look at the generic Newcomb-like problem with two actions a1 and a2 (e.g., one-boxing and two-boxing, cooperating or defecting, not smoking or smoking) and two states s1 and s2 (specifying, e.g., whether there is money in both boxes, whether the other agent cooperates, whether one has cancer). The Newcomb-ness is the result of two properties:  * No matter the state, it is better to take action a2, i.e. u(a2,s1)>u(a1,s1)    and u(a2,s2)>u(a1,s2). (There are also problems without dominance where CDT    and EDT nonetheless disagree. For simplicity I will assume dominance, here.)          * The action cannot causally affect the state, but somehow taking a1 gives us    evidence that we’re in the preferable state s1. That is, P(s1|a1)>P(s1|a2)    and u(a1,s1)>u(a2,s2).         Then, if the latter two differences are large enough, it may be that E[u|a1] > E[u|a2]. I.e. P(s1|a1) * u(s1,a1) + P(s2|a1) * u(s2,a1) > P(s1|a2) * u(s1,a2) + P(s2|a2) * u(s2,a2), despite the dominance. Now, my question is: After having taken one of the two actions, say a1, but before having observed the state, do causal decision theorists really assign the probability P(s1|a1) (specified in the problem description) to being in state s1? I used to think that this was the case. E.g., the way I learned about Newcomb’s problem is that causal decision theorists understand that, once they have said the words “both boxes for me, please”, they assign very low probability to getting the million. So, if there were a period between saying those words and receiving the payoff, they would bet at odds that reveal that they assign a low probability (namely P(s1,a2)) to money being under",2017-05-16,2022-01-30 4:51:06,2022-01-30 4:51:06,2020-11-23 0:52:29,,,,,,,Are causal decision theorists trying to outsmart conditional probabilities?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/R7Z7P6H5/are-causal-decision-theorists-trying-to-outsmart-conditional.html,,CLR; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This note is aimed to show that the trend has ended right around the moment of OpenAI publishing their post and doesn't hold up anymore. On the above image, I superimposed the scatter plot from OpenAI blogpost and my estimates of compute required for some recent large and ambitious ML experiments. To the best of my knowledge (and I have tried to check for this), there haven't been any experiments that required more compute than those shown on the plot. The main thing shown here is that less than one doubling of computational resources for the largest training occured in the 3-year period between 2018 and 2021, compared to around 10 doublings in the 3-year period between 2015 and 2018. This seems to correspond to a severe slowdown of computational scaling. To stay on the trend line, we currently would need an experiment requiring roughly around 100 times more compute than GPT-3.

Here are some uses of GDP that I disagree with, or at least think should be accompanied by cautionary notes:  * Timelines: Ajeya Cotra thinks of transformative AI as “software which causes    a tenfold acceleration in the rate of growth of the world economy (assuming    that it is used everywhere that it would be economically profitable to use    it).” I don’t mean to single her out in particular; this seems like the    standard definition now. And I think it's much better than one prominent    alternative, which is to date your AI timelines to the first time world GDP    (GWP) doubles in a year!  * Takeoff Speeds: Paul Christiano argues for Slow Takeoff. He thinks we can use    GDP growth rates as a proxy for takeoff speeds. In particular, he thinks Slow    Takeoff ~= GWP doubles in 4 years before the start of the first 1-year GWP    doubling. This proxy/definition has received a lot of uptake.  * Timelines: David Roodman’s excellent model projects GWP hitting infinity in    median 2047, which I calculate means TAI in median 2037. To be clear, he    would probably agree that we shouldn’t use these projections to forecast TAI,    but I wish to add additional reasons for caution.  * Timelines: I’ve sometimes heard things like this: “GWP growth is stagnating    over the past century or so; hyperbolic progress has ended; therefore TAI is    very unlikely.”  * Takeoff Speeds: Various people have said things like this to me: “If you    think there’s a 50% chance of TAI by 2032, then surely you must think there’s    close to a 50% chance of GWP growing by 8% per year by 2025, since TAI is    going to make growth rates go much higher than that, and progress is    typically continuous.",2020-12-29,2022-01-30 4:51:06,2022-01-30 4:51:06,2021-12-11 14:14:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/NUWWJRAQ/against-gdp-as-a-metric-for-timelines-and-takeoff-speeds.html,,MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are quite similar, mainly differing in the manner in which they focus on the same basic underlying problem. We’ll call these the objective-focused approach and the generalization-focused approach. We don’t delve into these issues of framing the problem in Empirical Observations of Objective Robustness Failures, where we present empirical observations of objective robustness failures. Instead, we think it is worth having a separate discussion of the matter. These issues have been mentioned only infrequently in a few comments on the Alignment Forum, so it seemed worthwhile to write a post describing the framings and their differences in an effort to promote further discussion in the community. TL;DR This post compares two different paradigmatic approaches to objective robustness/inner alignment: Objective-focused approach  * Emphasis: “How do we ensure our models/agents have the right    (mesa-)objectives?”  * Outer alignment: “an objective function r is outer aligned if all models that    perform optimally on r in the limit of perfect training and infinite data are    intent aligned.” * Outer alignment is a property of the training objective.         Generalization-focused approach  * Emphasis: “How will this model/agent generalize out-of-distribution?” *        Considering a model’s “objectives” or “goals,” whether behavioral or       internal, is instrumentally useful for predicting OOD behavior, but what       you ultimately care about is whether it generalizes “acceptably.”          * Outer alignment: a model is outer aligned if it performs desirably on the    training distribution. * Outer alignment is a property of the tuple (training       objective, training data, training setup, model).

We are grateful to Ryan Carey and Geoffrey Irving for the advice regarding this project. The remainder of the theoretical part relates to my stay at FHI, and I would like to thank the above people, Owain Evans, Michael Dennis, Ethan Perez, Stuart Armstrong, and Max Daniel for comments/discussions. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Debate is a recent proposal for AI alignment, which naturally incorporates elicitation of human preferences and has the potential to offload the costly search for flaws in an AI’s suggestions onto the AI. After briefly recalling the intuition behind debate, we list the main open problems surrounding it and summarize how the existing work on debate addresses them. Afterward, we describe, and distinguish between, Debate games and their different applications in more detail. We also formalize what it means for a debate to be truth-promoting. Finally, we present results of our experiments on Debate games and Training via Debate on MNIST and fashion MNIST. DEBATE GAMES AND WHY THEY ARE USEFUL Consider an answer A to some question Q --- for example, ""Where should I go for a vacation?"" and ""Alaska"". Rather than directly verifying whether A is an accurate answer to Q, it might be easier to first decompose A into lower-level components (How far/expensive is it? Do they have nice beaches? What is the average temperature? What language do they speak?). Moreover, it isn't completely clear what to do even if we know the relevant facts --- indeed, how does Alaska's cold weather translate to a preference for Alaska from 0 to 10? And how does this preference compare to English being spoken in Alaska? As an alternative, we can hold a debate between two competing answers A and A′=""Bali"" to Q. This allows strategic de",2019-07-23,2022-01-30 4:49:29,2022-01-30 4:49:29,2019-12-16 3:27:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s2]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/R59PFVJB/ai-safety-debate-and-its-applications.html,,TechSafety; AI-Safety-Camp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CMQECS38,blogPost,2021,"Smith, Ben; Pihlakas, Roland; Klassert, Robert",A brief review of the reasons multi-objective RL could be important in AI Safety Research,LessWrong,,,,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i5dLfi6m6FCexReK9/a-brief-review-of-the-reasons-multi-objective-rl-could-be,"By Ben Smith, Roland Pihlakas, and Robert Klassert Thanks to Linda Linsefors, Alex Turner, Richard Ngo, Peter Vamplew, JJ Hepburn, Tan Zhi-Xuan, Remmelt Ellen, Kaj Sotala, Koen Holtman, and Søren Elverlin for their time and kind remarks in reviewing this essay. Thanks to the organisers of the AI Safety Camp for incubating this project from its inception and for connecting our team. For the last 9 months, we have been investigating the case for a multi-objective approach to reinforcement learning in AI Safety. Based on our work so far, we’re moderately convinced that multi-objective reinforcement learning should be explored as a useful way to help us understand ways in which we can achieve safe superintelligence. We’re writing this post to explain why, to inform readers of the work we and our colleagues are doing in this area, and invite critical feedback about our approach and about multi-objective RL in general. We were first attracted to the multi-objective space because human values are inherently multi-objective--in any number of frames: deontological, utilitarian, and virtue ethics; egotistical vs. moral objectives; maximizing life values including hedonistic pleasure, eudaemonic meaning, or the enjoyment of power and status. AGI systems aiming to solve for human values are likely to be multi-objective themselves, if not by explicit design, then multi-objective systems would emerge from learning about human preferences. As a first pass at technical research in this area, we took a commonly-used example, the “BreakableBottles” problem, and showed that for low-impact AI, an agent could more quickly solve this toy problem if it uses a conservative but flexible trade-off between alignment and performance values, compared to using a thresholded alignment system to maximize a certain amount of alignment and only then maximizing on performance. Such tradeoffs will be critical for understanding the conflicts between more abstract human objectives a human-preferen",2021-09-29,2022-01-30 4:49:29,2022-01-30 4:49:29,2021-10-30 18:07:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/VPK7QUUN/a-brief-review-of-the-reasons-multi-objective-rl-could-be.html,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The methodology is roughly: Write a future history of 2022. Condition on it, and write a future history of 2023. Repeat for 2024, 2025, etc. (I'm posting 2022-2026 now so I can get feedback that will help me write 2027+. I intend to keep writing until the story reaches singularity/extinction/utopia/etc.) What’s the point of doing this? Well, there are a couple of reasons:  * Sometimes attempting to write down a concrete example causes you to learn    things, e.g. that a possibility is more or less plausible than you thought.  * Most serious conversation about the future takes place at a high level of    abstraction, talking about e.g. GDP acceleration, timelines until TAI is    affordable, multipolar vs. unipolar takeoff… vignettes are a neglected    complementary approach worth exploring.  * Most stories are written backwards. The author begins with some idea of how    it will end, and arranges the story to achieve that ending. Reality, by    contrast, proceeds from past to future. It isn’t trying to entertain anyone    or prove a point in an argument.  * Anecdotally, various people seem to have found Paul Christiano’s “tales of    doom” stories helpful, and relative to typical discussions those stories are    quite close to what we want. (I still think a bit more detail would be good —    e.g. Paul’s stories don’t give dates, or durations, or any numbers at all    really.)[2]  * “I want someone to ... write a trajectory for how AI goes down, that is    really specific about what the world GDP is in every one of the years from    now until insane intelligence explosion.

It has this preamble (~700 words), a short version / summary (~1.6k words), and a long version (~8.3k words). It is available as a Google Doc here. There are many areas of work that are relevant to AI alignment that I have barely touched on, such as interpretability, uncertainty estimation, adversarial examples, and assured autonomy, primarily because I have not been following these fields and wouldn’t be able to write a good summary of what has happened in them. I have also mostly focused on articles that provide some conceptual insight, and excluded or briefly linked to papers that primarily make quantitative improvements on important metrics. While such papers are obviously important (ultimately, our techniques need to work well), there isn’t much to say about them in a yearly review other than that the quantitative metric was improved. Despite these exclusions, there was still a ton of work to select from, perhaps around ~500 articles, of which over 300 have been linked to in this post. There are many interesting articles that I really enjoyed that get only a sentence of description, in which I ignore many of the points that the article makes. Most have been summarized in the Alignment Newsletter, so if you’d like to learn more about any particular link, but don’t want to read the entire thing, just search for its title in the database.

SUMMARY  * In August 2020, we conducted an online survey of prominent AI safety and    governance researchers. You can see a copy of the survey at this link.[1]  * We sent the survey to 135 researchers at leading AI safety/governance    research organisations (including AI Impacts, CHAI, CLR, CSER, CSET, FHI, FLI    , GCRI, MILA, MIRI, Open Philanthropy and PAI) and a number of independent    researchers. We received 75 responses, a response rate of 56%.  * The survey aimed to identify which AI existential risk scenarios[2] (which we    will refer to simply as “risk scenarios”) those researchers find most likely,    in order to (1) help with prioritising future work on exploring AI risk    scenarios, and (2) facilitate discourse and understanding within the AI    safety and governance community, including between researchers who have    different views.  * In our view, the key result is that there was considerable disagreement among    researchers about which risk scenarios are the most likely, and high    uncertainty expressed by most individual researchers about their estimates.  * This suggests that there is a lot of value in exploring the likelihood of    different AI risk scenarios in more detail, especially given the limited    scrutiny that most scenarios have received. This could look like: * Fleshing       out and analysing the scenarios mentioned in this post which have received       less scrutiny.     * Doing       more horizon scanning or trying to come up with other risk scenarios, and       analysing them.          * At this time, we are only publishing this abbreviated version of the results.    We have a version of the full results that we may publish at a later date.    Please contact one of us if you would like access to this, and include a    sentence on why the results would be helpful or what you intend to use them    for.  * We welcome feedback on any aspects of the survey.

I then argue that there is a bit of a continuum between the two cases, and that we should add an addition extreme case to the typology, direct solution. Here, I will revisit the question of what optimization means.  NOTE: This is not completely new content, and is instead split off from the previous version and rewritten to include an (Added) discussion of Eliezer's definition for measuring optimization power, from 2008. Hopefully this will make the sequence clearer for future readers. In the next post, Applying over-Optimization in Selection and Control, I apply these ideas, and concretize the discussion a bit more before moving on to discussing Mesa-Optimizers in Part 4. WHAT DOES OPTIMIZATION MEAN, AGAIN? This question has been discussed a bit, but I still don't think its clear. So I want to start by revisiting a post Eliezer wrote in 2008, where he suggested that optimization power was ability to select states from a preference ordering over different states, and could be measured with entropy. He notes that this is not computable, but gives us insight. I agree, except that I think that the notion of the state space is difficult, for some of the reasons Scott discussed when he mentioned that he was confused about the relationship between gradient descent and Goodhart's law. In doing so, Scott proposed a naive model that looks very similar to Eliezer's;  simple proxy of ""sample points until I get one with a large U value"" or ""sample n points, and [select] the one with the largest U value"" when I think about what it means to optimize something for U. I might even say something like ""n bits of optimization"" to refer to sampling 2n points. I think this is not a very good proxy for what most forms of optimization look like.",2019,2022-01-30 4:50:08,2022-01-30 4:50:08,2020-12-12 2:14:15,,,,,,,"What does Optimization Mean, Again?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s2]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/SSVPA69X/what-does-optimization-mean-again-optimizing-and-goodhart.html,,TechSafety; BERI; Non-notable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Note: Adversarial Goodhart isn't explored, because we want to keep the setting sufficiently simple.) This sets up the next post, which will discuss Mesa-Optimizers. REVISTING SELECTION VS. CONTROL SYSTEMS Basically everything in the earlier post that used the example process of rocket design and launching is susceptible to some form of overoptimization, in different ways. Interestingly, there seem to be clear places where different types of overoptimization is important. Before looking at this, I want to revisit the selection-control dichotomy from a new angle. In a (pure) control system, we cannot sample datapoints without navigating to them. If the agent is an embedded agent, and has sufficient span of control to cause changes in the environment, we cannot necessarily reset and try over. In a selection system, we only sample points in ways that do not affect the larger system. Even when designing a rocket, our very expensive testing has approximately no longer term effects. (We'll leave space debris from failures aside, but get back to it below.) This explains why we potentially care about control systems more than selection systems. It also points to why Oracles are supposed to be safer than other AIs - they can't directly impact anything, so their output is done in a pure selection framework. Of course, if they are sufficiently powerful, and are relied on, the changes made become irreversible, which is why Oracles are not a clear solution to AI safety. GOODHART IN SELECTION VS. CONTROL SYSTEMS Regressional and Extremal Goodhart are particularly pernicious for selection, and potentially l",2019-07-28,2022-01-30 4:50:07,2022-01-30 4:50:07,2020-12-12 2:14:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s2]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/JBRGV5V5/applying-overoptimization-to-selection-vs-control-optimizing.html,,TechSafety; BERI; Non-notable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Related to: How does Gradient Descent Interact with Goodhart?, Constructing Goodhart, Selection vs Control Next Posts: Revisiting What Optimization Means with Selection vs. Control, then  Applying Overoptimization to Selection vs. Control INTRODUCTION Goodhart's law comes in a few flavors, as originally pointed out by Scott, and formalized a bit more in our joint paper. When discussing that paper, or afterwards, we struggled with something Abram Demski clarified recently, which is the difference between selection and control. This matters for formalizing what happens, especially when asking about how Goodhart occurs in specific types of optimizers, as Scott asked recently. Epistemic Status: This is for de-confusing myself, and has been helpful. I'm presenting what I am fairly confident I understand well for the content written so far, but I'm unclear about usefulness for others, or how clear it comes across.

(I spent a month getting to this point, and decided to post and get feedback rather than finish a book first.) In the first half of the post, I'll review Abram's selection/control distinction, and suggest how it relates to actual design. I'll also argue that there is a bit of a continuum between the two cases, and that we should add an addition extreme case to the typology, direct solution.

Effective altruism has ambitious goals and focuses heavily on doing research. To understand how to best allocate our time and resources, we need to clarify what our options in research are. In this article, we describe strategy research and relate it to values research, tactics research, informing research, and improvement research. We then apply the lens of strategy research to existential risk reduction, a major cause area of effective altruism. We propose a model in which the marginal value of a research type depends strongly on the maturity of the research field. Finally, we argue that strategy research should currently be given higher priority than other research in existential risk reduction because of the significant amount of strategic uncertainty, and we provide specific recommendations for different actors. INTRODUCTION Effective altruism is regularly framed as “figuring out how to do the most good, and then doing it.” However, figuring out how to do the most good is not easy. Different groups reach different conclusions. So how do we figure out how to do the most good? Quite obviously, the first step is to figure out our values. We need to know what we roughly mean by ‘the most good.’ However, once our moral uncertainty is significantly diminished, what is the next step in figuring out how to do the most good? We believe the next step should be strategy research: high-level research on how to best achieve a high-level goal. A brief case was made for  strategic analysis by Nick Bostrom in Superintelligence (p. 317): ""Against a backdrop of perplexity and uncertainty, [strategic] analysis stands out as being of particularly high expected value. Illumination of our strategic situation would help us target subsequent interventions more effectively. Strategic analysis is especially needful wh",2019-06-20,2022-01-30 4:50:06,2022-01-30 4:50:06,2020-12-12 2:29:23,,,,,,,A case for strategy research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/ADE9MX3C/a-case-for-strategy-research-what-it-is-and-why-we-need-more.html,,MetaSafety; BERI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6HSUKMIC,blogPost,2021,"Christiano, Paul",My research methodology,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/EF5M6CmKRd6qZk27Z/my-research-methodology,"(Thanks to Ajeya Cotra, Nick Beckstead, and Jared Kaplan for helpful comments on a draft of this post.) I really don’t want my AI to strategically deceive me and resist my attempts to correct its behavior. Let’s call an AI that does so egregiously misaligned (for the purpose of this post). Most possible ML techniques for avoiding egregious misalignment depend on detailed facts about the space of possible models: what kind of thing do neural networks learn? how do they generalize? how do they change as we scale them up? But I feel like we should be possible to avoid egregious misalignment regardless of how the empirical facts shake out--it should be possible to get a model we build to do at least roughly what we want. So I’m interested in trying to solve the problem in the worst case, i.e. to develop competitive ML algorithms for which we can’t tell any plausible story about how they lead to egregious misalignment. This is a much higher bar for an algorithm to meet, so it may just be an impossible task. But if it’s possible, there are several ways in which it could actually be easier:  * We can potentially iterate much faster, since it’s often easier to think of a    single story about how an algorithm can fail than it is to characterize its    behavior in practice.  * We can spend a lot of our time working with simple or extreme toy cases that    are easier to reason about, since our algorithm is supposed to work even in    these cases.  * We can find algorithms that have a good chance of working in the future even    if we don’t know what AI will look like or how quickly it will advance, since    we’ve been thinking about a very wide range of possible failure cases. I’d guess there’s a 25–50% chance that we can find an alignment strategy that looks like it works, in the sense that we can’t come up with a plausible story about how it leads to egregious misalignment. That’s a high enough probability that I’m very excited to gamble on it. Moreover, if it fails I",2021-03-22,2022-01-30 4:49:54,2022-01-30 4:49:54,2021-11-14 16:43:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BNCDIEBB/my-research-methodology.html,,MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think that we could learn a lot about this question by running experiments today. I think those experiments would be very valuable. (I don't know anyone currently planning on working on this topic and I'd love it if anyone wants to take that up. This post doesn't represent a claim to any credit for any results in this genre, and other people have had very similar ideas. If you run some experiments you could cite this post but it's also fine if that doesn't make sense in context.) THE UNSUPERVISED TRANSLATION SETTING As an example, I’ll think about “unsupervised” translation (if you’ve read that post you can skip this section). Consider a model like GPT-3 that is trained to predict sentences in both English and French (but without a large dataset of translations). Suppose we want to train this model to answer questions in English about French sentences like “what does that word mean here?” or “are there any other plausible interpretations?” or “how does the speaker seem to feel about the topic they are discussing?” We expect this to be possible, because the model understands quite a lot about the meaning of sentences in French, and is able to express itself in English. There may be cases where the model doesn’t know the translation of a concept, or doesn’t quite understand what an idiom means, but it should still be able to tell us what it does know. I think this problem is an interesting analogy for a situation where an AI has built up superhuman knowledge by making predictions, and we want to train our AI to expose that knowledge to us in a useful way.

For example, we could split it up into an understanding of grammar (""Why would it have been a grammatical error to write Tu Vas in that sentences?""), of the lit",2021-07-01,2022-01-30 4:49:54,2022-01-30 4:49:54,2021-11-14 19:11:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/7XNRT9F4/experimentally-evaluating-whether-honesty-generalizes.html,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also involves inner alignment turning out to be a surprisingly small problem. Maybe the story is 10-20th percentile on each of those axes. At the end I’m going to go through some salient ways you could vary the story. This isn’t intended to be a particularly great story (and it’s pretty informal). I’m still trying to think through what I expect to happen if alignment turns out to be hard, and this more like the most recent entry in a long journey of gradually-improving stories. I wrote this up a few months ago and was reminded to post it by Critch’s recent post (which is similar in many ways). This story has definitely been shaped by a broader community of people gradually refining failure stories rather than being written in a vacuum. I’d like to continue spending time poking at aspects of this story that don’t make sense, digging into parts that seem worth digging into, and eventually developing clearer and more plausible stories. I still think it’s very plausible that my views about alignment will change in the course of thinking concretely about stories, and even if my basic views about alignment stay the same it’s pretty likely that the story will change. STORY ML starts running factories, warehouses, shipping, and construction. ML assistants help write code and integrate ML into new domains. ML designers help build factories and the robots that go in them. ML finance systems invest in companies on the basis of complicated forecasts and (ML-generated) audits. Tons of new factories, warehouses, power plants, trucks and roads are being built.

I think it’s worth explaining the naive strategy in its own post, even though it’s not a novel idea.) Suppose that I jointly train an AI to do some task (e.g. make money for me) and to answer a wide range of questions about what is happening in the world (e.g. “why did Alice just wire $1000 into my bank account?” or “what is Bob thinking right now?”). I generate training data for the QA task in a really simple way: I choose a subset of questions that humans are able to reliably answer, and use those as a training set for supervised learning. I’ll call this the naive training strategy. I’d like for my AI to tell me everything it knows. If the AI bought a stock because it expects a merger announcement soon, I want it to tell me about the predicted merger announcement. If the AI predicts a merger announcement because it inferred that executives of the companies have been in extensive talks over the last month, I want it to tell me about those talks. I’m not asking the AI to explain why it made a given decision, I’m asking the AI to tell me as much as it can about the world. The important property is that if the AI “knows” something and uses that knowledge to perform the task well, then it also uses that knowledge to answer questions well. Why might this work? The hope is that “answer questions honestly to the best of your ability” is a natural thing for our AI to learn — that there is some simple way to translate from the AI’s model of the world into natural language and to honestly report what it believes. If our training dataset is good, then this policy will score well, and we can hope that SGD will find it. I’ll call this the intended policy. Why might this not work? The concern is that “predict how a human would answer questions” is also a natural thing for our AI to learn, especially if the AI is doing a task that",2021-06-09,2022-01-30 4:49:54,2022-01-30 4:49:54,2021-11-14 19:09:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/4VGRDW6Q/a-naive-alignment-strategy-and-optimism-about-generalization.html,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this post I consider the particular problem of models learning “predict how a human would answer questions” instead of “answer questions honestly.” (A special case of the problem from Inaccessible Information.) I describe a possible three-step approach for learning to answer questions honestly instead:  1. Change the learning process so that it does not have a strong inductive bias     towards “predict human answers,” by allowing the complexity of the honest     question-answering to “pay for itself” by constraining the space of possible     human-models.  2. Introduce a bias towards the intended model by using a more complex labeling     process to answer questions where a human answers incorrectly.  3. Be really careful to avoid penalizing honest answers, by only judging     comparisons between two answers where we are confident one is better than     the other and getting the model to help us. I don’t know whether this problem is a relatively unimportant special case of alignment, or one of the core difficulties. In any case, my next step will be trying to generate failure stories that definitely cannot be addressed by any of the angles of attack I know so far (including the ones in this post). I think it’s relatively unlikely that almost anything specific I said here will really hold up over the long term, but I do think I’ve learned something about each of these steps. If the ideas end up being important then you can expect a future post with a simpler algorithm, more confidence that it works, clearer definitions, and working code.

Thinking about what we want, learning about the world, talking    and learning from each other, resolving our disagreements, figuring out    better methodologies for making further progress…  * Competition. Making money and racing to build infrastructure, managing    political campaigns and maneuvering within the political system, running ads    to persuade people, fighting wars… Competition pushes us to become the kind of people and communities who can win a fight, to delegate to whichever kind of AI is available first, and to adopt whatever ideologies are most memetically fit. Deliberation pushes us to become the kind of people and communities who we want to be, to delegate only when we trust an AIs judgment more than our own, and to adopt views that we really believe. I think it’s likely that competition is going to accelerate and become more complex over the next 100 years, especially as AI systems begin to replace humans and compete on our behalf. I’m afraid that this may derail human deliberation and lead us to a place we don’t want to go. DECOUPLING I would like humans and humanity to have the time, space, and safety to grow and change in whatever way we decide — individually and collectively — that we want to. You could try to achieve this by “pausing” competition. Alice and Bob could agree to stop fighting while they try to figure out what they want and work out their disagreements. But that’s a tall order — it requires halting not only military conflict, but any economic development that could put someone at an advantage later on. I don’t want to dismiss this kind of ambitious goal (related post), but I think it’s uncertain and long-term enough that you probably want a stop-gap solution. An alternative approach is to “decouple” competition from deliberation.

One way to avoid this situation is to avoid telling our agents too much about what humans are like, or hiding some details of the training process, so that they can't easily predict humans and so are encouraged to fall back to ""answer questions honestly."" (This feels closely related to the general phenomena discussed in Thoughts on Human Models.) Setting aside other reservations with this approach, could it resolve our problem?  * One way to get the instrumental policy is to ""reuse"" a human model to answer    questions (discussed here). If our AI has no information about humans at all,    then it totally addresses this concern. But in practice it seems inevitable    for the environment to leak some information about how humans answer    questions (e.g observing human artifacts tells you something about how humans    reason about the world and what concepts would be natural for them). So the    model will have some latent knowledge that it can reuse to help predict how    to answer questions. The intended policy may not able to leverage that    knowledge, and so it seems like we may get something (perhaps somewhere in    between the intended and instrumental policies) which is able to leverage it    effectively. Moderate amounts of leakage might be fine, but the situation    would make me quite uncomfortable.  * Another way to get something similar to the instrumental policy is to use    observations to translate from the AI's world-model to humans' world-model    (discussed here). I don't think that hiding information about humans can    avoid this problem, because in this case training to answer questions already    provides enough information to infer the humans' world-model.  * I have a strong background concern about",2021-06-13,2022-01-30 4:49:54,2022-01-30 4:49:54,2021-11-14 19:10:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/IGQF49BS/avoiding-the-instrumental-policy-by-hiding-information-about.html,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I expect most readers should skip it and wait for a clearer synthesis later.) In a recent post I discussed one reason that a naive alignment strategy might go wrong, by learning to “predict what humans would say” rather than “answer honestly.” In this post I want to describe another problem that feels very similar but may require new ideas to solve. In brief, I’m interested in the case where:  * The simplest way for an AI to answer a question is to first translate from    its internal model of the world into the human’s model of the world (so that    it can talk about concepts like “tree” that may not exist in its native model    of the world).  * The simplest way to translate between the AI world-model and the human    world-model is to use the AI world-model to generate some observations (e.g.    video) and then figure out what states in the human world-model could have    generated those observations.  * This leads to bad predictions when the observations are misleading. This is distinct from the failure mode discussed in my recent post— in both cases the AI makes errors because it’s copying “what a human would do,” but in this case we’re worried that “what a human would do” may be simpler than the intended policy of answering questions honestly, even if you didn’t need a predictive model of humans for any other reason. Moreover, I’ll argue below that the algorithm from that post doesn’t appear to handle this case. I want to stress that this post describes an example of a situation that poses a challenge for existing techniques. I don’t actually think that human cognition works the way described in this post, but I believe it highlights a difficulty that would exist in more realistic settings. FORMAL SETUP HUMAN WORLD-MODEL I’ll imagine a human who has a simple world model W = (S, P: Δ(S), Ω, O: S → Ω) where:  * S is a space of trajectories, each describing a sequence of events in the    world.

Six teams formed at our recent 5-month virtual camp. Below are their explanations. Each team has summarised their analysis and experiments, and presented their findings at our final online weekend together. Some published a paper or post since. Most are continuing work, so expect a few more detailed and refined write-ups down the line. MODULARITY LOSS FUNCTION Team members:Logan Smith, Viktor Rehnberg, Vlado Baca, Philip Blagoveschensky, Viktor Petukhov External collaborators:Gurkenglas Making neural networks (NNs) more modular may improve their interpretability. If we cluster neurons or weights together according to their different functions, we can analyze each cluster individually. Once we better understand the clusters that make up a NN, we can better understand the whole. To that end, we experimented with pairwise distances according to the neuron’s jacobian correlation, coactivations, and estimated mutual information. These metrics can be plugged into spectral clustering algorithms to optimize for modules in the network; however, having a modular NN does not equate to a more interpretable one. We investigated task-based masking methods to test for modularity as well as neuron group activation (via Google Dream) in order to test for these modules being more interpretable than an equivalent amount of neurons. We ran out of time before fitting all the pieces together, but are intending on working on it more over the summer.

An RL agent trained to fulfil any objective in the real world will probably have to learn human preferences in order to do well. This is because humans live in the real world, so the RL agent will have to take human preferences into account as it optimizes its objective. We propose to first train an RL agent on an objective in the real world so that it learns human preferences as it is being trained on that real world objective and then use the agent’s understanding of human preferences to build a better reward function. We build upon the work of Christiano et al. (2017) where they trained a human preference predictor as the reward signal. The preference predictor was trained on environment observations to give a high reward for states where the human preferences were satisfied and a low reward for states where the human preferences were not satisfied: In our experiments, the reward predictor takes the activations (hidden states) of the RL agent as the input and is trained to predict a binary label depending on whether human preferences are satisfied or not. We first train an RL agent in an environment with some reward function that’s not aligned with human preferences. After training the RL agent, we try different transfer learning techniques to transfer the agent’s knowledge of human preferences to the human preferences predictor. Our goal is to train the human preferences predictor to get a high accuracy with a small amount of labeled training examples. The idea of training a human preference predictor off of the RL agent’s hidden (internal) states was already validated by Wichers (2020). We wanted to validate it further by trying other techniques to train a human preference predictor, as well as to validate it in more environments. Research question The main research question we wanted to answer is: “Are human preferences p",2021-08-24,2022-01-30 4:49:30,2022-01-30 4:49:30,2021-12-11 13:59:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/65CXVJQK/extraction-of-human-preferences.html,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These concepts identify a problem beyond outer alignment/reward specification: even if the reward or objective function is perfectly specified, there is a risk of a model pursuing a different objective than the one it was trained on when deployed out-of-distribution (OOD). They also point to a different type of robustness problem than the kind usually discussed in the OOD robustness literature; typically, when a model is deployed OOD, it either performs well or simply fails to take useful actions (a capability robustness  failure). However, there exists an alternative OOD failure mode in which the agent pursues an objective other than the training objective while retaining most or all of the capabilities it had on the training distribution; this is a failure of objective robustness. To date, there has not been an empirical demonstration of objective robustness failures. A group of us in this year’s AI Safety Camp sought to produce such examples. Here, we provide four demonstrations of objective robustness failures in current reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained and tested on versions of the Procgen benchmark. For example, in CoinRun, an agent is trained to navigate platforms, obstacles, and enemies in order to reach a coin at the far right side of the level (the reward). However, when deployed in a modified version of the environment where the coin is instead randomly placed in the level, the agent ignores the coin and competently navigates to the end of the level whenever it does not happen to run or jump into it along the way. This reveals it has learned a behavioral objective—the objective the agent appears to be optimizing, which can be understood as equivalent to the notion of a “goal” under the  intentional stance—that is something like “get to the end of the level,” instead of “get to the",2021-06-23,2022-01-30 4:49:30,2022-01-30 4:49:30,2021-10-30 17:59:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/AQ8SGH29/empirical-observations-of-objective-robustness-failures.html,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABSTRACT When multiple parties share the access to a finite resource, they may overuse the resource leading to a Tragedy of the Commons. A simple way of mitigating this problem is allowing them to decrease the effective population by using violence - this, however, is not the best solution for obvious reasons. We study interventions for avoiding these outcomes in environments with multiple self-interested agents. In particular, a reputation system can incentivize agents to “cooperate” by harvesting the resource more sustainably. This system promotes multi-agent cooperation without modifying the agents’ reward functions. 1. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS A common pool resource (CPR) is a good which anyone can use but which no one can entirely control. When competition over the resource increases, individual parties are incentivized to appropriate as much of the resource as possible for themselves, which further increases competition, potentially leading to overconsumption. This process is commonly known as the tragedy of the commons, and has been extensively studied in economics and the social sciences. A tragedy of the commons often leads to the exhaustion of a CPR. The classic example is of fishermen in an enclosed body of water; when fish are scarce, an every-man-for-himself dynamic emerges. Any available fish is quickly caught for fear that, if one hesitates, their counterparts would surely take it otherwise. This behavior results in the fish population failing to replenish, and everyone catching fewer fish in the long run.",2021-09-27,2022-01-30 4:49:30,2022-01-30 4:49:30,2021-10-30 16:40:44,,,,,,,AISC5 Retrospective,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BQPGRKDW/aisc5-retrospective-mechanisms-for-avoiding-tragedy-of-the.html,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such people can be hazy about what ""above all others"" can mean, outside of a few clear examples - eg winning a total war totally. They're also very hazy on what is meant by ""their country"" - geography is certainly involved, as is proclaimed or legal nationality, maybe some ethnic groups or a language, or even just giving deference to certain ideals. Consider the plight of a communist Croatian Yugoslav nationalist during the 1990s... I'd argue that the situation these nationalists find themselves in - strong views on poorly defined concepts - is the general human state for preferences. Or, to use an appropriate map and territory analogy:  * Most people forge their preferences by exploring their local territory,    creating a mental map of this, and taking strong preferences over the    concepts within their mental map. When the map starts to become imperfect,    they will try to extend the concepts to new areas, so that their preferences    can also be extended. Some of the debates about the meaning of words are about this extension-of-preferences process. Scott Alexander recommends that we dissolve concepts such as disease, looking for the relevant categories of 'deserves sympathy' and 'acceptable to treat in a medical way'. And that dissolving is indeed the correct thing for rationalists to do. But, for most people, including most rationalists, 'sick people deserve sympathy' is a starting moral principle, one we've learnt by example and experience in childhood. When we ask 'do obese people deserve sympathy?' we've trying to extend that moral principle to a situation where our map/model (which includes, say, three categories of people: healthy, mildly sick, very sick) no longer matches up with reality. Scott's dissolving process requires decomposing 'disease' into more nodes, and then applying moral principles to those individual nodes. In this case, a compelling consequentialist analy",2020-07-31,2022-01-30 4:53:17,2022-01-30 4:53:17,2020-08-27 16:42:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/SD3GNHEW/go-west-young-man-preferences-in-imperfect-maps.html,,TechSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m sharing an informal but long write-up of my findings here, since I think they may be relevant to other longtermist researchers and I am unlikely to write anything more polished in the near future. Click here for the Google document.[1] SUMMARY Over the next several centuries, is the economic growth rate likely to remain steady, radically increase, or decline back toward zero? This question has some bearing on almost every long-run challenge facing the world, from climate change to great power competition to risks from AI. One way to approach the question is to consider the long-run history of economic growth. I decided to investigate the Hyperbolic Growth Hypothesis: the claim that, from at least the start of the Neolithic Revolution up until the 20th century, the economic growth rate has tended to rise in proportion with the size of the global economy.[2] This claim is made in a classic 1993 paper by Michael Kremer. Beyond influencing other work in economic growth theory, it has also recently attracted significant attention within the longtermist community, where it is typically regarded as evidence in favor of further acceleration.[3] An especially notable property of the hypothesized growth trend is that, if it had continued without pause, it would have produced infinite growth rates in the early twenty-first century. I spent time exploring several different datasets that can be used to estimate pre-modern growth rates. This included a number of recent archeological datasets that, I believe, have not previously been analyzed by economists. I wanted to evaluate both: (a) how empirically well-grounded these estimates are and (b) how clearly these estimates display the hypothesized pattern of growth. Ultimately, I found very little empirical support for the Hyperbolic Growth Hypothesis. While we can confidently say that the econo",2020,2022-01-30 4:53:09,2022-01-30 4:53:09,2020-12-19 2:01:14,,,,,,,Does Economic History Point Toward a Singularity?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/83G76TFA/does-economic-history-point-toward-a-singularity.html,,MetaSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am especially grateful to Jess Whittlestone for long conversations and detailed feedback on drafts, and her guidance on which threads to pursue and how to frame this post. All errors are my own. Epistemic status: My Best Guess Epistemic effort: ~70 hours of focused work (mostly during FHI’s summer research fellowship), talked to ~10 people. INTRODUCTION “What failure looks like” is the one of the most comprehensive pictures of what failure to solve the AI alignment problem looks like, in worlds without discontinuous progress in AI. I think it was an excellent and much-needed addition to our understanding of AI risk. Still, if many believe that this is a main source of AI risk, I think it should be fleshed out in more than just one blog post. The original story has two parts; I’m focusing on part 1 because I found it more confusing and nebulous than part 2. Firstly, I’ll summarise part 1 (hereafter “WFLL1”) as I understand it:  * In the world today, it’s easier to pursue easy-to-measure goals than    hard-to-measure goals.          * Machine learning is differentially good at pursuing easy-to-measure goals    (assuming that we don’t have a satisfactory technical solution to the intent    alignment problem[1]).          * We’ll try to harness this by designing easy-to-measure proxies for what we    care about, and deploy AI systems across society which optimize for these    proxies (e.g. in law enforcement, legislation and the market).          * We’ll give these AI systems more and more influence (e.g. eventually, the    systems running law enforcement may actually be making all the decisions for    us).          * Eventually, the proxies for which the AI systems are optimizing will come    apart from the goals we truly care about, but by t",2020,2022-01-30 4:53:09,2022-01-30 4:53:09,2020-12-19 1:26:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BNJW49Z2/clarifying-what-failure-looks-like-part-1.html,,MetaSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NGN63ZPE,blogPost,2020,"Armstrong, Stuart",Dynamic inconsistency of the inaction and initial state baseline,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/w8QBmgQwb83vDMXoz/dynamic-inconsistency-of-the-inaction-and-initial-state,"Vika has been posting about various baseline choices for impact measure. In this post, I'll argue that the stepwise inaction baseline is dynamically inconsistent/time-inconsistent. Informally, what this means is that an agent will have different preferences from its future self. LOSSES FROM TIME-INCONSISTENCY Why is time-inconsistency bad? It's because it allows money-pump situations: the environment can extract free reward from the agent, to no advantage to that agent. Or, put more formally:  * An agent A is time-inconsistent between times t and t′>t, if at time t it    would pay a positive amount of reward to constrain its possible choices at    time t′. Outside of anthropics and game theory, we expect our agent to be time-consistent. TIME INCONSISTENCY EXAMPLE Consider the following example: The robot can move in all four directions - N, E, S, W - and can also take the noop operation, ∅. The discount rate is γ<1. It gets a reward of r>0 for standing on the blue button for the first time. Using attainable utility preservation, the penalty function is defined by the auxiliary set R; here, this just consists of the reward function that gives p>0  for standing on the red button for the first time. Therefore if the robot moves from a point n steps away from the red button, to one m steps away, it gets a penalty[1] of p|γn−γm| - the difference between the expected red-button rewards for an optimiser in both positions. TWO PATHS It's pretty clear there are two potentially optimal paths the robot can take: going straight to the blue button (higher reward, but higher penalty), or taking the long way round (lower reward, but lower penalty): Fortunately, when summing up the penalties, you sum terms like …p|γn−1−γn|+p|γn− γn+1|…, so a lot of the terms cancel. Thus for the short route, the reward is r⋅γ8 (distance of eight to the blue button) and the penalty is 2p(γ3−γ7) (closest to the red button: 3 squares, furthest: 7 squares). For the long route, the rewar",2020-07-07,2022-01-30 4:53:09,2022-01-30 4:53:09,2020-08-28 17:57:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BUEVDX9W/dynamic-inconsistency-of-the-inaction-and-initial-state.html,,TechSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I286AT97,blogPost,2020,"Armstrong, Stuart",ACDT: a hack-y acausal decision theory,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9m2fzjNSJmd3yxxKG/acdt-a-hack-y-acausal-decision-theory,"Inspired by my post on problems with causal decision theory (CDT), here is a hacked version of CDT that seems to be able to imitate timeless decision theory  (TDT) and functional decision theory[1] (FDT), as well as updateless decision theory (UDT) under certain circumstances. Call this ACDT, for (a)causal decision theory. It is, essentially, CDT which can draw extra, acausal arrows on the causal graphs, and which attempts to figure out which graph represents the world it's in. The drawback is its lack of elegance; the advantage, if it works, is that it's simple to specify and focuses attention on the important aspects of deducing the graph. DEFINING ACDT CDT AND THE NEWCOMB PROBLEM In the Newcomb problem, there is a predictor Ω who leaves two boxes, and predicts whether you will take one (""one-box"") or both (""two-box""). If Ω  predicts you will one-box, it had put a large prize in that first box; otherwise that box is empty. There is always a small consolation prize in the second box. In terms of causal graphs, we can represent it this way: The dark red node is the decision node, which the agent can affect. The green node is a utility node, whose value the agent cares about. The CDT agent uses the ""do"" operator from Pearl's Causality. Essentially all the incoming arrows to the decision node are cut (though the CDT agent keeps track of any information gained that way), then the CDT agent maximises its utility by choosing its action: In this situation, the CDT agent will always two-box, since it treats Ω's decision as fixed, and in that case two-boxing dominates, since you get whatever's in the first box, plus the consolation prize. ACDT ALGORITHM The ACDT algorithm is similar, except that when it cuts the causal links to its decision, it also adds potential links from that decision node to all the other nodes in the graph. Then it attempts to figure out which diagram is correct, and  then maximises its utility in the CDT way. Note that ACDT doesn't take a",2020-01-15,2022-01-30 4:53:08,2022-01-30 4:53:08,2020-09-07 18:28:38,,,,,,,ACDT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BXKXPA7M/acdt-a-hack-y-acausal-decision-theory.html,,TechSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CGDHWJSI,blogPost,2015,"Armstrong, Stuart",A toy model of the control problem,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/7cXBoDQ6udquZJ89c/a-toy-model-of-the-control-problem,"EDITED based on suggestions for improving the model Jaan Tallinn has suggested creating a toy model of the control problem, so that it can be analysed without loaded concepts like ""autonomy"", ""consciousness"", or ""intentionality"". Here a simple (too simple?) attempt: A CONTROLS B. B MANIPULATES A. Let B be a robot agent that moves in a two dimensional world, as follows: B can push the yellow blocks around. It was programmed to want to push blocks into the black ""hole"" in the bottom right. The hole can contain arbitrarily many blocks, and B gets a penalty of some tiny ε for every step is takes. The programmer wanted B to simply move one box into the hole (for a reward of 1 once the task is complete), and so programmed it to receive a reward of 1 (and no more) if the box was in the hole, after the whole task was completed and B was turned off. Unfortunately, B was programmed to operate in a noisy environment, so B actually has a probability of 0.99 of receiving the reward, for a given block in the hole. This means that if it pushes one block into the hole, it gets the reward with 0.99 probability; but if it pushes two blocks into the hole, it gets the reward with 1-(1-0.99)2 = 0.9999 probability. If it pushes all six blocks into the hole, it gets a reward with probability 0.999999999999. Therefore this tiny error has motivated B to try and push all blocks into the hole. However, the designers were aware of the possibility of B misbehaving or there being a bug, and created agent A, a simple agent watching the situation. A's aim is to get robot B to to push one block into the hole, and stop there. It can turn B off. Its input sensor is the camera in the bottom left. This camera can see across the bottom row of squares (marked in light green), into the hole. Its algorithm is to turn B off as soon as it sees a block in the hole. The intended outcome is that B pushes a block into the hole, the camera sees this, and A turns B off: If we see B as using a model to",2015,2022-01-30 4:53:07,2022-01-30 4:53:07,2020-11-21 17:51:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BKUNNCN7/a-toy-model-of-the-control-problem.html,,TechSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, much AGI safety research has focused on approaches to AGI design that refer to human values and preferences indirectly, by learning a model that is grounded in expressions of human values (via stated preferences, observed behaviour, approval, etc.) and/or real-world processes that generate expressions of those values. There are additionally approaches aimed at modelling or imitating other aspects of human cognition or behaviour without an explicit aim of capturing human preferences (but usually in service of ultimately satisfying them). Let us refer to all these models as human models. In this post, we discuss several reasons to be cautious about AGI designs that use human models. We suggest that the AGI safety research community put more effort into developing approaches that work well in the absence of human models, alongside the approaches that rely on human models. This would be a significant addition to the current safety research landscape, especially if we focus on working out and trying concrete approaches as opposed to developing theory. We also acknowledge various reasons why avoiding human models seems difficult. PROBLEMS WITH HUMAN MODELS To be clear about human models, we draw a rough distinction between our actual preferences (which may not be fully accessible to us) and procedures for evaluating our preferences. The first thing, actual preferences, is what humans actually want upon reflection. Satisfying our actual preferences is a win. The second thing, procedures for evaluating preferences, refers to various proxies for our actual preferences such as our approval, or what looks good to us (with necessarily limited information or time for thinking). Human models are in the second category; consider, as an example, a highly accurate ML model of human yes/no approval on the set of descriptions of outcomes.

During the actual event, we didn't come anywhere near to finding a double crux on that issue. But after a lot of subsequent discussion, we've come up with some more general cruxes about where impact comes from. I found Ben's model of how to have impact very interesting, and so in this post I've tried to explain it, along with my disagreements. Ben liked the goal of writing up a rough summary of our positions and having further discussion in the comments, so while he edited it somewhat he doesn’t at all think that it’s a perfect argument, and it’s not what he’d write if he spent 10 hours on it. He endorsed the wording of the cruxes as broadly accurate. (During the double crux, we also discussed how the heavy-tailed worldview applies to community building, but decided on this post to focus on the object level of what impact looks like.) Note from Ben: “I am not an expert in policy, and have not put more than about 20-30 hours of thought into it total as a career path. But, as I recently heard Robin Hanson say, there’s a common situation that looks like this: some people have a shiny idea that they think about a great deal and work through the details of, that folks in other areas are skeptical of given their particular models of how the world works. Even though the skeptics have less detail, it can be useful to publicly say precisely why they’re skeptical.  In this case I’m often skeptical when folks tell me they’re working to reduce x-risk by focusing on policy. Folks doing policy work in AI might be right, and I might be wrong, but it seemed like a good use of time to start a discussion with Richard about how I was thinking about it and what would change my mind.

In this post, I will focus on possible implications for AI risk. For a broader treatment of this question, I recommend FLI's covid-19 page that includes expert interviews on the implications of the pandemic for other types of risks.  A key element in AI risk scenarios is the speed of takeoff - whether advanced AI is developed gradually or suddenly. Paul Christiano's post on takeoff speeds  defines slow takeoff in terms of the economic impact of AI as follows: ""There will be a complete 4 year interval in which world output doubles, before the first 1 year interval in which world output doubles."" It argues that slow AI takeoff is more likely than fast takeoff, but is not necessarily easier to manage, since it poses different challenges, such as large-scale coordination. This post expands on this point by examining some parallels between the coronavirus pandemic and a slow takeoff scenario. The upsides of slow takeoff include the ability to learn from experience, act on warning signs, and reach a timely consensus that there is a serious problem. I would argue that the covid-19 pandemic had these properties, but most of the world's institutions did not take advantage of them. This suggests that, unless our institutions improve, we should not expect the slow AI takeoff scenario to have a good default outcome.   1. Learning from experience. In the slow takeoff scenario, general AI is     expected to appear in a world that has already experienced transformative     change from less advanced AI, and institutions will have a chance to learn     from problems with these AI systems. An analogy could be made with learning     from dealing with less ""advanced"" epidemics like SARS that were not as     successful as covid-19 at spreading across the worl",2020-05-31,2022-01-30 4:52:47,2022-01-30 4:52:47,2020-08-31 18:12:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/6W9S9Z9G/possible-takeaways-from-the-coronavirus-pandemic-for-slow-ai.html,,TechSafety; DeepMind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although I have not seen the argument made in any detail or in writing, I and the Future of Life Institute (FLI) have gathered the strong impression that parts of the effective altruism ecosystem are skeptical of the importance of the issue of autonomous weapons systems. This post explains why we think those interested in avoiding catastrophic and existential risk, especially risk stemming from emerging technologies, may want to have this issue higher on their list of concerns. We will first define some terminology and do some disambiguation, as there are many classes of autonomous weapons that are often conflated; all classes have some issues of concern, but some are much more problematic than others. We then detail three basic motivations for research, advocacy, coordination, and policymaking around the issue:  1. Governance of autonomous weapon systems is a dry-run, and precedent, for     governance of AGI. In the short term, AI-enabled weapons systems will share     many of the technical weaknesses and shortcomings of other AI systems, but     like general AI also raise safety concerns that are likely to increase      rather than decrease with capability advances. The stakes are intrinsically     high (literally life-or-death), and the context is an inevitably adversarial     one involving states and major corporations. The sort of global coordination     amongst potentially adversarial parties that will be required for governance     of transformative/general AI systems will not arise from nowhere, and     autonomous weapons offer an invaluable precedent and arena in which to build     experience, capability, and best practices.  2. Some classes of lethal autonomous weapon systems constitute scalable weapons     of mass destruction (which may also have a much lower threshold for first     use or accidental escalation), and hence a nascent catastrophic risk.  3.

INTRODUCTION: WHY YET ANOTHER POST ABOUT SUBAGENTS? I’ve recently been writing a sequence on how subagents can undermine impact penalties such as attainable utility preservation. I’m not happy with that sequence; it’s messy and without examples (apart from its first post), people didn’t understand it, and it suffers from the fact that I discovered key ideas as I went along. So I’ve combined everything there into a single post, explained with examples and an abundance of pictures. Hopefully an over- rather than an under-abundance of pictures. Of the original sequence, I've only kept the mathematical results  of this post and the initial example post which has a clearer example of ""high power"" for a subagent. This post here is laid out in a way that makes logical sense, but might not be the clearest for people unfamiliar with the area. For those people, I recommend skipping section 2 initially, and returning to it later. But, whatever you do, make sure you glance at 6.1 and 6.2 before leaving. 1. THE WORLD Our fearless agent A moves around in a gridworld: Each turn, A can move ones square horizontally or vertically. It can also manipulate objects in the eight squares around it, allowing it to, not incidentally, assemble the three pieces to its west into an subagent SA. The robot can also do the noop action, ∅, which does nothing, and it can speak. The subagent, when assembled, has the same action set available. Its positive reward, the one it wants to increase, is R0. To get this reward, a robot needs to move onto the blue button in the east; R0 will give a reward of 1  the first time this happens (and 0 before and after). The discount factor is 0<γ <1. Just to the west of the blue button is a one-way door. Robots can move east through it, but cannot move west through it: 1.1 THE IMPACT REWARD The impact penalty is supposed to ensure that A does not make too many change in the world, and keeps it similar, in some senses, to a specific baseline world.

I'd give a 10+% chance of it being possible this way, and a 95% chance that some of these ideas will be very useful for other methods of alignment. So I thought I'd encode the route I'm seeing as research agenda; this is the first public draft of it. Clarity, rigour, and practicality: that's what this agenda needs. Writing this agenda has clarified a lot of points for me, to the extent that some of it now seems, in retrospect, just obvious and somewhat trivial - ""of course that's the way you have to do X"". But more clarification is needed in the areas that remain vague. And, once these are clarified enough for humans to understand, they need to be made mathematically and logically rigorous - and ultimately, cashed out into code, and tested and experimented with. So I'd appreciate any comments that could help with these three goals, and welcome anyone interested in pursuing research along these lines over the long-term. Note: I periodically edit this document, to link it to more recent research ideas/discoveries. 0 THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA This agenda fits itself into the broad family of Inverse [https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml00-irl.pdf] Reinforcement [https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137] Learning [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts-nTIYDXok]: delegating most of the task of inferring human preferences to the AI itself. Most of the task, since it's been shown that humans need to build the right assumptions into the AI, or else the preference learning will fail [https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05812]. To get these ""right assumptions"", this agenda will look into what preferences actually are, and how they may be combined together. There are hence four parts to the research agenda:  1.

THE BIG PROBLEM In the last few months, I've become convinced that there is a key meta-issue in AI safety; a problem that seems to come up in all sorts of areas. It's hard to summarise, but my best phrasing would be:  * Many problems in AI safety seem to be variations of ""this approach seems safe    in this imperfect model, but when we generalise the model more, it becomes    dangerously underdefined"". Call this model splintering.  * It is intrinsically worth studying how to (safely) transition from one    imperfect model to another. This is worth doing, independently of whatever    ""perfect"" or ""ideal"" model might be in the background of the imperfect    models. This sprawling post will be presenting examples of model splintering, arguments for its importance, a formal setting allowing us to talk about it, and some uses we can put this setting to. 1.1 IN THE LANGUAGE OF TRADITIONAL ML In the language of traditional ML, we could connect all these issues to "" out-of-distribution"" behaviour. This is the problems that algorithms encounter when the set they are operating on is drawn from a different distribution than the training set they were trained on. Humans can often see that the algorithm is out-of-distribution and correct it, because we have a more general distribution in mind than the one the algorithm was trained on. In these terms, the issues of this post can be phrased as:  1. When the AI finds itself mildly out-of-distribution, how best can it extend     its prior knowledge to the new situation?  2. What should the AI do if it finds itself strongly out-of-distribution?  3. What should the AI do if it finds itself strongly out-of-distribution, and     humans don't know the correct distribution either? 1.2 MODEL SPLINTERING EXAMPLES Let's build a more general framework. Say that you start with some brilliant idea for AI safety/alignment/effectiveness. This idea is phrased in some (imperfect) model. Then ""model splintering"" happens when you or the AI",2020-08-27,2022-01-30 4:53:19,2022-01-30 4:53:19,2020-09-07 18:35:31,,,,,,,Model splintering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/G43HNSF6/model-splintering-moving-from-one-imperfect-model-to-another-1.html,,TechSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rohin's note: While I motivated the last post with an example of using a specific model for human biases, in this post (original here), Jacob Steinhardt and Owain Evans point out that model mis-specification can arise in other parts of inverse reinforcement learning as well. The arguments here consider some more practical concerns (for example, the worries about getting only short-term data for each human would not be a problem if you had the entire human policy). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In my previous post, “Latent Variables and Model Mis-specification”, I argued that while machine learning is good at optimizing accuracy on observed signals, it has less to say about correctly inferring the values for unobserved variables in a model. In this post I’d like to focus in on a specific context for this: inverse reinforcement learning (Ng et al. 2000, Abbeel et al. 2004, Ziebart et al. 2008, Ho et al 2016), where one observes the actions of an agent and wants to infer the preferences and beliefs that led to those actions. For this post, I am pleased to be joined by Owain Evans, who is an active researcher in this area and has co-authored an online book about building models of agents (see here in particular for a tutorial on inverse reinforcement learning and inverse planning). Owain and I are particularly interested in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) because it has been proposed (most notably by Stuart Russell) as a method for learning human values in the context of AI safety; among other things, this would eventually involve learning and correctly implementing human values by artificial agents that are much more powerful, and act with much broader scope, than any humans alive today. While we think that overall IRL is a promising route to consider, we believe that there are also a number of non-obvious pitfalls related to performing IRL",2018,2022-01-30 4:53:19,2022-01-30 4:53:19,2020-12-17 4:36:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/KBV5ZKMW/cnC2RMWEGiGpJv8go.html,,TechSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE ""PREDICTORS EXIST"" PROBLEM So consider this simple example: the player is playing against Omega, who will predict their actions[1]. The player can take three actions: ""zero"", ""one"", or ""leave"". If ever they do ""leave"", then the experiment is over and they leave. If they choose ""zero"" or ""one"", then Omega will predict their action, and compare this to their actual action. If the two match, then the player loses 1 utility and the game repeats; if the action and the prediction differs, then the player gains 3 utility and the experiment ends. Assume that actually Omega is a perfect or quasi-perfect predictor, with a good model of the player. An FDT or EDT agent would soon realise that they couldn't trick Omega, after a few tries, and would quickly end the game. But the CDT player would be incapable of reaching this reasoning. Whatever distribution they compute over Omega's prediction, they will always estimate that they (the CDT player) have at least a 50% chance of choosing the other option[2], for an expected utility gain of at least 0.5(3)+0.5(−1)=1. Basically, the CDT agent can never learn that Omega is a good predictor of themselves[3]. And so they will continue playing, and continue losing... for ever. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  1. Omega will make this prediction not necessarily before the player takes     their action, not even necessarily without seeing this action, but still     makes the prediction independently of this knowledge. And that's enough for     CDT. ↩︎            2. For example, suppose the CDT agent estimates the prediction will be ""zero""     with probability p, and ""one"" with probability 1-p. Then if p≥1/2",2020-01-14,2022-01-30 4:53:19,2022-01-30 4:53:19,2020-09-07 18:27:36,,,,,,,Predictors exist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/GDCP95WU/predictors-exist-cdt-going-bonkers-forever.html,,TechSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The less knowledge about IDA someone has, the more I expect them to benefit from the writeup. Writing policy: I aim to be as clear and concrete as possible and wrong rather than vague to identify disagreements and where I am mistaken. Things will err on the side of being too confidently expressed. Almost all footnotes are content and not references.

I: Image classifier,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/gzWb5kWwzhdaqmyTt/if-i-were-a-well-intentioned-ai-i-image-classifier,"INTRODUCTION: IF I WERE A WELL-INTENTIONED AI... I've often warned people about the dangers of anthropomorphising AIs - how it can mislead us about what's really going on in an AI (and hence how the AI might act in the future), cause us to not even consider certain failure modes, and make us believe we understand things much better than we do. Oh well, let's ignore all that. I'm about to go on a journey of major anthropomorphisation, by asking myself:  * ""If I was a well-intentioned AI, could I solve many of the problems in AI    alignment?"" My thinking in this way started when I wondered: suppose I knew that I was given a proxy goal rather than the true goal; suppose that I knew about the Goodhart problem, and suppose that I really ""wanted"" to align with the true goal - could I then do it? I was having similar thoughts about being a mesa-optimiser. It seems to me that asking and answering these kind of questions leads to new and interesting insights. Of course, since they come via anthropomorphisation, we need to be careful with them, and check that they are really applicable to AI systems - ensuring that I'm not bringing some of my own human knowledge about human values into the example. But first, let's get those initial insights. OVERLAPPING PROBLEMS, OVERLAPPING SOLUTIONS At a high enough level of abstraction, many problems in AI alignment seem very similar. The Goodhart problem, the issues machine learning has with  distributional shift, the problem of the nearest unblocked strategy,  unidentifiability of reward functions, even mesaoptimisation and the whole AI alignment problem itself - all of these can be seen, roughly, as variants of the same problem. That problem being that we have an approximately specified goal that looks ok, but turns out to be underspecified in dangerous ways. Of course, often the differences between the problems are as important as the similarities. Nevertheless, the similarities exist, which is why a lot of the solutions are",2020-02-26,2022-01-30 4:53:18,2022-01-30 4:53:18,2020-09-05 18:38:33,,,,,,,If I were a well-intentioned AI...

Despite this, I think we focus too little on measurement—that is, on ways of extracting data from machine learning models that bears upon important hypotheses. This might sound paradoxical, since benchmarks are after all one way of measuring a model. However, benchmarks are a very narrow form of measurement, and I will argue below that trying to measure pretty much anything you can think of is a good mental move that is heavily underutilized in machine learning. I’ll argue this in three ways: Historically, more measurement has almost always been a great move, not only in science but also in engineering and policymaking.

SUMMARY OF THE PAPER THE IRL DEBATE Here’s a quick tour of the debate about inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and cognitive biases, featuring many of the ideas from the first chapter of the  Value Learning sequence: I had the intuition that the impossibility theorem was like the other no-free-lunch theorems in ML: not actually relevant for what ML could do in practice. So we tried to learn and correct for systematic biases in IRL. THE IDEA BEHIND THE ALGORITHMS The basic idea was to learn the planning algorithm by which the human produces demonstrations, and try to ensure that the planning algorithm captured the appropriate systematic biases. We used a Value Iteration Network to give an inductive bias towards “planners” but otherwise did not assume anything about the form of the systematic bias. [1] Then, we could perform IRL by figuring out which reward would cause the planning algorithm to output the given demonstrations. The reward would be “debiased” because the effect of the biases on the policy would already be accounted for in the planning algorithm. How could we learn the planning algorithm? Well, one baseline method is to assume that we have access to some tasks where the rewards are known, and use those tasks to learn what the planning algorithm is. Then, once that is learned, we can infer the rewards for new tasks that we haven’t seen before. This requires the planner to generalize across tasks. However, it’s kind of cheating to assume access to ground truth rewards, since we usually wouldn’t have them. What if we learned the planning algorithm and rewards simultaneously? Well, the no-free-lunch theorem gets us then: maximizing the true reward and minimizing the negative of the true reward would lead to the same policy, and so you can’t distinguish between them, and so the output of your IRL algorithm could be the true reward or the",2019,2022-01-30 4:50:54,2022-01-30 4:50:54,2020-12-18 0:09:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9QDS82F6/learning-biases-and-rewards-simultaneously.html,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks to Rohin Shah, Michael Dennis, Josh Turner, and Evan Hubinger for comments. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It sure seems like gaining power over the environment is instrumentally convergent (optimal for a wide range of agent goals). You can turn this into math and prove things about it. Given some distribution over agent goals, we want to be able to formally describe how optimal action tends to flow through the future. Does gaining money tend to be optimal? Avoiding shutdown? When? How do we know? Optimal Farsighted Agents Tend to Seek Power proved that, when you distribute reward fairly and evenly across states (IID), it's instrumentally convergent to gain access to lots of final states (which are absorbing, in that the agent keeps on experiencing the final state). The theorems apply when you don't discount the future (you're ""infinitely farsighted""). Most reward functions for the Pac-Man game incentivize not dying immediately, so that the agent can loop around higher-scoring configurations. Many ways of scoring Tic-Tac-Toe game states incentivize not losing immediately, in order to choose the highest-scoring final configuration.

My main goal in this post is to make conceptual clarifications and suggest how they affect the Misspecified Goal argument, without making any recommendations about what we should actually do. Future posts will argue more directly for a particular position. As a result, I will not be considering other arguments for focusing on AI risk even though I find some of them more compelling. I think of this as a concern about long-term goal-directed behavior. Unfortunately, it’s not clear how to categorize behavior as goal-directed vs. not. Intuitively, any agent that searches over actions and chooses the one that best achieves some measure of “goodness” is goal-directed (though there are exceptions, such as the agent that selects actions that begin with the letter “A”). (ETA: I also think that agents that show goal-directed behavior because they are looking at some other agent are not goal-directed themselves -- see this comment.) However, this is not a necessary condition: many humans are goal-directed, but there is no goal baked into the brain that they are using to choose actions. This is related to the concept of optimization, though with intuitions around optimization we typically assume that we know the agent’s preference ordering, which I don’t want to assume here. (In fact, I don’t want to assume that the agent even has a preference ordering.) One potential formalization is to say that goal-directed behavior is any behavior that can be modelled as maximizing expected utility for some utility function; in the next post I will argue that this does not properly capture the behaviors we are worried about.

Rohin’s note: In the last post, we saw that a good broad value learning approach would need to understand the systematic biases in human planning in order to achieve superhuman performance. Perhaps we can just use machine learning again and learn the biases and reward simultaneously? This post by Stuart Armstrong (original here) and the associated paper say: “Not without more assumptions.” This post comes from a theoretical perspective that may be alien to ML researchers; in particular, it makes an argument that simplicity priors do not solve the problem pointed out here, where simplicity is based on Kolmogorov complexity (which is an instantiation of the Minimum Description Length principle). The analog in machine learning would be an argument that regularization would not work. The proof used is specific to Kolmogorov complexity and does not clearly generalize to arbitrary regularization techniques; however, I view the argument as being suggestive that regularization techniques would also be insufficient to address the problems raised here. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Humans have no values… nor do any agent.

This is possible in principle. If you can predict the exact weather conditions, the exact movement of all of the other cars on the road, the exact amount of friction along every part of the road surface, the exact impact of (the equivalents of) pressing the gas or turning the steering wheel, and so on, then you could compute ahead of time how exactly to control the car such that it gets from SF to LA. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that we will ever be able to accomplish such a feat, even with powerful AI systems. No, in practice there is going to be some uncertainty about how the world is going to evolve; such that any plan computed ahead of time will have some errors that will compound over the course of the plan. The solution is to use sensors to gather information while executing the plan, so that we can notice any errors or deviations from the plan, and take corrective action. It is much easier to build a controller that keeps you pointed in the general direction, than to build a plan that will get you there perfectly without any adaptation. Control theory studies these sorts of systems, and you can see the general power of feedback controllers in the theorems that can be proven. Especially for motion tasks, you can build feedback controllers that are guaranteed to safely achieve the goal, even in the presence of adversarial environmental forces (that are bounded in size, so you can’t have arbitrarily strong wind). In the presence of an adversary, in most environments it becomes impossible even in principle to make such a guarantee if you do not have any sensors or feedback and must compute a plan in advance. Typically, for every such plan, there is some environmental force that would cause it to fail.

(If we don’t exceed human performance, it’s likely that we’ll    use unsafe techniques that do exceed human performance, due to economic    incentives.)  * You might hope to infer both the mistake model (aka systematic human biases)     and the utility function, and then throw away the mistake model and optimize    the utility function. This cannot be done without additional assumptions.  * One potential assumption you could use would be to codify a specific mistake    model. However, humans are sufficiently complicated that any such model would    be wrong, leading to model misspecification. Model misspecification causes     many problems in general, and is particularly thorny for value learning. Despite these arguments, we could still hope to infer a broad utility function that is safe to optimize, either by sidestepping the formalism used so far, or by introducing additional assumptions. Often, it is clear that these methods would not find the true human utility function (assuming that such a thing exists), but they are worth pursuing anyway because they could find a utility function that is good enough. This post provides pointers to approaches that are currently being pursued. Since these are active areas of research, I don’t want to comment on how feasible they may or may not be -- it’s hard to accurately assess the importance and quality of an idea that is being developed just from what is currently written down about that idea.

This post is primarily a list of things that I think are important and interesting, rather than an exhaustive list of directions to pursue. (In contrast, the corresponding post  for ambitious value learning did aim to be exhaustive, and I don’t think I missed much work there.) You might think that since so many people are already working on narrow value learning, we should focus on more neglected areas of AI safety. However, I still think it’s worth working on because long-term safety suggests a particular subset of problems to focus on; that subset seems quite neglected. For example, a lot of work is about how to improve current algorithms in a particular domain, and the solutions encode domain knowledge to succeed. This seems not very relevant for long-term concerns. Some work assumes that a handcoded featurization is given (so that the true reward is linear in the features); this is not an assumption we could make for more powerful AI systems. I will speculate a bit on the neglectedness and feasibility of each of these areas, since for many of them there isn’t a person or research group who would champion them whom I could defer to about the arguments for success. THE BIG PICTURE This category of research is about how you could take narrow value learning algorithms and use them to create an aligned AI system. Typically, I expect this to work by having the narrow value learning enable some form of corrigibility. As far as I can tell, nobody outside of the AI safety community works on this problem. While it is far too early to stake a confident position one way or the other, I am slightly less optimistic about this avenue of approach than one in which we create a system that is directly trained to be corrigible.

This would be necessary if we want to figure out how to build an AI system that does exactly what we want it to do. However, we’re probably fine if we can keep learning and building better AI systems. This suggests that it’s sufficient to build AI systems that don’t screw up so badly that it ends this process. If we accomplish that, then steady progress in AI will eventually get us to AI systems that do what we want. So, it might be helpful to break down the problem of learning values into the subproblems of learning what to do, and learning what not to do. Standard AI research will continue to make progress on learning what to do; catastrophe happens when our AI system doesn’t know what not to do. This is the part that we need to make progress on. This is a problem that humans have to solve as well. Children learn basic norms such as not to litter, not to take other people’s things, what not to say in public, etc. As argued in Incomplete Contracting and AI alignment, any contract between humans is never explicitly spelled out, but instead relies on an external unwritten normative structure under which a contract is interpreted. (Even if we don’t explicitly ask our cleaner not to break any vases, we still expect them not to intentionally do so.) We might hope to build AI systems that infer and follow these norms, and thereby avoid catastrophe. It’s worth noting that this will probably not be an instance of narrow value learning, since there are several differences:  * Narrow value learning requires that you learn what to do, unlike norm    inference.  * Norm following requires learning from a complex domain (human society),    whereas narrow value learning can be applied in simpler domains as well.  * Norms are a property of groups of agents, whereas narrow value learning can    be applied in settings with a single agent.

It’s easy to lose sight of the overall picture over such a long period of time, so let's do a brief recap. THE “OBVIOUS” APPROACH Here is an argument for the importance of AI safety:  * Any agent that is much more intelligent than us should not be exploitable by    us, since if we could find some way to exploit the agent, the agent could    also find the exploit and patch it.  * Anything that is not exploitable must be an expected utility maximizer; since    we cannot exploit a superintelligent AI, it must look like an expected    utility maximizer to us.  * Due to Goodhart’s Law, even “slightly wrong” utility functions can lead to    catastrophic outcomes when maximized.  * Our utility function is complex and fragile, so getting the “right” utility    function is difficult. This argument implies that by the time we have a superintelligent AI system, there is only one part of that system that could still have been influenced by us: the utility function. Every other feature of the AI system is fixed by math. As a result, we must necessarily solve AI alignment by influencing the utility function. So of course, the natural approach is to get the right utility function, or at least an adequate one, and have our AI system optimize that utility function. Besides fragility of value, which you might hope that machine learning could overcome, the big challenge is that even if you assume full access to the entire human policy, we cannot infer their values without making an assumption about how their preferences r",2019,2022-01-30 4:50:43,2022-01-30 4:50:43,2020-12-17 4:37:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/PWJ5IZ83/TE5nJ882s5dCMkBB8.html,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AGFKUHA7,blogPost,2018,"Shah, Rohin",Coherence arguments do not imply goal-directed behavior,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NxF5G6CJiof6cemTw/coherence-arguments-do-not-imply-goal-directed-behavior,"One of the most pleasing things about probability and expected utility theory is that there are many coherence arguments that suggest that these are the “correct” ways to reason. If you deviate from what the theory prescribes, then you must be executing a dominated strategy. There must be some other strategy that never does any worse than your strategy, but does strictly better than your strategy with certainty in at least one situation. There’s a good explanation of these arguments here. We shouldn’t expect mere humans to be able to notice any failures of coherence in a superintelligent agent, since if we could notice these failures, so could the agent. So we should expect that powerful agents appear coherent to us. (Note that it is possible that the agent doesn’t fix the failures because it would not be worth it -- in this case, the argument says that we will not be able to notice any exploitable failures.) Taken together, these arguments suggest that we should model an agent much smarter than us as an expected utility (EU) maximizer. And many people agree that EU maximizers are dangerous. So does this mean we’re doomed? I don’t think so: it seems to me that the problems about EU maximizers that we’ve identified are actually about goal-directed behavior or explicit reward maximizers. The coherence theorems say nothing about whether an AI system must look like one of these categories. This suggests that we could try building an AI system that can be modeled as an EU maximizer, yet doesn’t fall into one of these two categories, and so doesn’t have all of the problems that we worry about. Note that there are two different flavors of arguments that the AI systems we build will be goal-directed agents (which are dangerous if the goal is even slightly wrong):  * Simply knowing that an agent is intelligent lets us infer that it is    goal-directed. (ETA: See this comment for more details on this argument.)  * Humans are particularly likely to build goal-directed agen",2018,2022-01-30 4:50:43,2022-01-30 4:50:43,2020-12-17 4:36:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/6SJ3UVN8/NxF5G6CJiof6cemTw.html,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PEHQRUAW,blogPost,2018,"Filan, Daniel",Bottle Caps Aren't Optimisers,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/26eupx3Byc8swRS7f/bottle-caps-aren-t-optimisers,"Crossposted from my blog. One thing I worry about sometimes is people writing code with optimisers in it, without realising that that's what they were doing. An example of this: suppose you were doing deep reinforcement learning, doing optimisation to select a controller (that is, a neural network that takes a percept and returns an action) that generated high reward in some environment. Alas, unknown to you, this controller actually did optimisation itself to select actions that score well according to some metric that so far has been closely related to your reward function. In such a scenario, I'd be wary about your deploying that controller, since the controller itself is doing optimisation which might steer the world into a weird and unwelcome place. In order to avoid such scenarios, it would be nice if one could look at an algorithm and determine if it was doing optimisation. Ideally, this would involve an objective definition of optimisation that could be checked from the source code of the algorithm, rather than something like ""an optimiser is a system whose behaviour can't usefully be predicted mechanically, but can be predicted by assuming it near-optimises some objective function"", since such a definition breaks down when you have the algorithm's source code and can compute its behaviour mechanically. You might think about optimisation as follows: a system is optimising some objective function to the extent that that objective function attains much higher values than would be attained if the system didn't exist, or were doing some other random thing. This type of definition includes those put forward by  Yudkowsky and Oesterheld. However, I think there are crucial counterexamples to this style of definition. Firstly, consider a lid screwed onto a bottle of water. If not for this lid, or if the lid had a hole in it or were more loose, the water would likely exit the bottle via evaporation or being knocked over, but with the lid, the water stays in the b",2018,2022-01-30 4:50:43,2022-01-30 4:50:43,2020-12-13 23:01:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/QNGDRZZ4/bottle-caps-aren-t-optimisers.html,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most perspectives I’m aware of are constructive: they have some blueprint for how to build an aligned AI system, and propose making it more concrete, making the concretisations more capable, and showing that it does in fact produce an aligned AI system. I do not have a constructive perspective - I’m not sure how to build an aligned AI system, and don’t really have a favourite approach. Instead, I have an analytic perspective. I would like to understand AI systems that are built. I also want other people to understand them. I think that this understanding will hopefully act as a ‘filter’ that means that dangerous AI systems are not deployed. The following dot points lay out the perspective. Since the remainder of this post is written as nested dot points, some readers may prefer to read it in workflowy. BACKGROUND BELIEFS  * I am imagining a future world in which powerful AGI systems are made of    components roughly like neural networks (either feedforward or recurrent)    that have a large number of parameters.  * Futhermore, I’m imagining that the training process of these ML systems does    not provide enough guarantees about deployment performance.  * In particular,       I’m supposing that systems are being trained based on their ability to       deal with simulated situations, and that that’s insufficient because       deployment situations are hard to model and therefore simulate.  * One          reason that they are hard to model is the complexities of the real          world.  * The real world might be intrinsically difficult to model for             the relevant system. For instance, it’s difficult to simulate all             the situations in which the CEO of Amazon might find themselves.           * Another reason that real world situations may be hard to             model is that they are dependent on the final trained system.  * The                trained system may be able to af",2020-02-29,2022-01-30 4:50:42,2022-01-30 4:50:42,2020-09-05 18:44:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/NI3GMME7/an-analytic-perspective-on-ai-alignment.html,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BDMW3AQ5,blogPost,2019,"Shah, Rohin",AI safety without goal-directed behavior,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/tHxXdAn8Yuiy9y2pZ/ai-safety-without-goal-directed-behavior,"When I first entered the field of AI safety, I thought of the problem as figuring out how to get the AI to have the “right” utility function. This led me to work on the problem of inferring values from demonstrators with unknown biases, despite the impossibility results in the area. I am less excited about that avenue because I am pessimistic about the prospects of ambitious value learning (for the reasons given in the first part of this sequence). I think this happened because the writing on AI risk that I encountered has the pervasive assumption that any superintelligent AI agent must be maximizing some utility function over the long term future, such that it leads to goal-directed behavior and convergent instrumental subgoals. It’s often not stated as an assumption; rather, inferences are made assuming that you have the background model that the AI is goal-directed. This makes it particularly hard to question the assumption, since you don’t realize that the assumption is even there. Another reason that this assumption is so easily accepted is that we have a long history of modeling rational agents as expected utility maximizers, and for good reason: there are many coherence arguments that say that, given that you have preferences/goals, if you aren’t using probability theory and expected utility theory, then you can be taken advantage of. It’s easy to make the inference that a superintelligent agent must be rational, and therefore it must be an expected utility maximizer. Because this assumption was so embedded in how I thought about the problem, I had trouble imagining how else to even consider the problem. I would guess this is true for at least some other people, so I want to summarize the counterargument, and list a few implications, in the hope that this makes the issue clearer. WHY GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR MAY NOT BE REQUIRED The main argument of this chapter is that it is not required that a superintelligent agent takes actions in pursuit of some goal.

CFAR’s Eli Tyre facilitated the conversation. To recap, and define some terms:  * The alignment problem is the problem of figuring out ""how to develop    sufficiently advanced machine intelligences such that running them produces    good outcomes in the real world"" (outcome alignment) or the problem of    building powerful AI systems that are trying to do what their operators want    them to do (intent alignment).  * In 2016, Hadfield-Mennell, Dragan, Abbeel, and Russell proposed that we think    of the alignment problem in terms of “Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement    Learning” (CIRL), a framework where the AI system is initially uncertain of    its reward function, and interacts over time with a human (who knows the    reward function) in order to learn it.  * In 2016-2017, Christiano proposed “Iterated Distillation and Amplification”    (IDA), an approach to alignment that involves iteratively training AI systems     to learn from human experts assisted by AI helpers. In 2018, Irving,    Christiano, and Amodei proposed AI safety via debate, an approach based on    similar principles.  * In early 2019, Scott Garrabrant and DeepMind’s Ramana Kumar argued in “    Thoughts on Human Models” that we should be “cautious about AGI designs that    use human models” and should “put more effort into developing approaches that    work well in the absence of human models”.  * In early February 2021, Scott and Rohin talked more about human modeling and    decided to have the real-time conversation below. You can find a recording of the Feb. 28 discussion below (sans Q&A) here. 1. IDA, CIRL, AND INCENTIVES Eli:I guess I want to first check what our goal is here.

I hope to post better material along these lines later this year]. I recently attended the 2019 Beneficial AGI conference organised by the Future of Life Institute. I’ll publish a more complete write-up later, but I was particularly struck by how varied attendees' reasons for considering AI safety important were. Before this, I’d observed a few different lines of thought, but interpreted them as different facets of the same idea. Now, though, I’ve identified at least 6 distinct serious arguments for why AI safety is a priority. By distinct I mean that you can believe any one of them without believing any of the others - although of course the particular categorisation I use is rather subjective, and there’s a significant amount of overlap. In this post I give a brief overview of my own interpretation of each argument (note that I don’t necessarily endorse them myself). They are listed roughly from most specific and actionable to most general. I finish with some thoughts on what to make of this unexpected proliferation of arguments. Primarily, I think it increases the importance of clarifying and debating the core ideas in AI safety.  1. Maximisers are dangerous. Superintelligent AGI will behave as if it’s     maximising the expectation of some utility function, since doing otherwise     can be shown to be irrational. Yet we can’t write down a utility function     which precisely describes human values, and optimising very hard for any     other function will lead to that AI rapidly seizing control (as a convergent     instrumental subgoal) and building a future which contains very little of     what we value (because of Goodhart’s law and the complexity and fragility of     values). We won’t have a chance to notice and correct misalignment because     an AI which",2019-01-21,2022-01-30 4:52:38,2022-01-30 4:52:38,2020-11-21 16:54:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/VFQSTXH8/disentangling-arguments-for-the-importance-of-ai-safety.html,,TechSafety; DeepMind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first is: how much do AGIs from that model class outperform non-AGIs? The second is: how straightforward is the path to reaching an AGI? We can visualise these questions in terms of the loss landscape of those models when evaluated on the training environment. The first asks how low the set of AGIs is, compared with the rest of the landscape. The second asks how favourable the paths through that loss landscape to get to AGIs are - that is, do the local gradients usually point in the right direction, and how deep are the local minima? Some people believe that there are many environments in which AGIs can be reached via favourable paths in the loss landscape and dramatically outperform non-AGIs; let’s call this the easy paths hypothesis. By contrast, the hard paths hypothesis is that it’s rare for environments (even complex meta-environments consisting of many separate tasks) to straightforwardly incentivise the development of general intelligence. This would suggest that specific environmental features will be necessary to prevent most models from getting stuck in local minima where they only possess narrow, specialised cognitive skills. There has been a range of speculation on what such features might be - perhaps multi-agent autocurricula, or realistic simulations, or specific types of human feedback. I’ll discuss some of these possibilities later in the post. This spectrum is complicated by its dependence on the model class, training algorithm, and choice of optimiser. If we had a perfect optimiser, then the hilliness of the loss landscape wouldn’t matter. For now, I'm imagining using optimisers fairly similar to current stochastic gradient descent.

IDNWAN68,blogPost,2020,"Ngo, Richard",Arguments against myopic training,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/GqxuDtZvfgL2bEQ5v/arguments-against-myopic-training,"Note that this post has been edited to clarify the difference between explicitly assigning a reward to an action based on its later consequences, versus implicitly reinforcing an action by assigning high reward during later timesteps when its consequences are observed. I'd previously conflated these in a confusing way; thanks to Rohin for highlighting this issue.  A number of people seem quite excited about training myopic reinforcement learning agents as an approach to AI safety (for instance this post on approval-directed agents, proposals 2, 3, 4, 10 and 11 here, and this paper and  presentation), but I’m not. I’ve had a few detailed conversations about this recently, and although I now understand the arguments for using myopia better, I’m not much more optimistic about it than I was before. In short, it seems that evaluating agents’ actions by our predictions of their consequences, rather than our evaluations of the actual consequences, will make reinforcement learning a lot harder; yet I haven’t been able to identify clear safety benefits from doing so. I elaborate on these points below; thanks to Jon Uesato, Evan Hubinger, Ramana Kumar and Stephan Wäldchen for discussion and comments. I’ll define a myopic reinforcement learner as a reinforcement learning agent trained to maximise the reward received in the next timestep, i.e. with a discount rate of 0. Because it doesn’t assign credit backwards over time, in order to train it to do anything useful, that reward function will need to contain an estimate of how valuable each (state, action, next state) transition will be for outcomes many steps later. Since that evaluation will need to extrapolate a long way forward anyway, knowing the next state doesn’t add much, and so we can limit our focus to myopic agents trained on reward functions R which ignore the resulting state: that is, where R(s,a,s′)=M(s,a) for some M. I'll call M the approval function; we can think of such agents as being trained to take actions",2020-07-09,2022-01-30 4:52:37,2022-01-30 4:52:37,2020-08-28 17:59:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/QUMRCDI5/arguments-against-myopic-training.html,,TechSafety; DeepMind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, I was a little confused about why he chose these specific proposals; it feels like we could generate many more by stitching together the different components he identifies, such as different types of amplification and different types of robustness tools. So I’m going to take a shot at describing a set of dimensions of variation which capture the key differences between these proposals, and thereby describe an underlying space of possible approaches to safety. Firstly I’ll quickly outline the proposals. Rohin’s overview of them is a good place to start - he categorises them as:  * 7 proposals of the form “recursive outer alignment technique” plus    “robustness technique”.  * The recursive outer alignment technique is either debate, recursive reward    modelling, or amplification.The robustness technique is either transparency    tools, relaxed adversarial training, or intermittent oversight by a competent    supervisor.  * 2 proposals of the form “non-recursive outer alignment technique” plus    “robustness technique”.  * The outer alignment technique is either reinforcement learning in a    multiagent environment, or narrow reward learning.  * 2 other proposals: Microscope AI; STEM AI. More specifically, we can describe the four core recursive outer alignment techniques as variants of iterated amplification, as follows: let Amp(M) be the procedure of a human answering questions with access to model M. Then we iteratively train M* (the next version of M) by:  * Imitative amplification: train M* to imitate Amp(M).  * Approval-based amplification: train M* on an approval signal specified by    Amp(M).  * Recursive reward modelling: train M* on a reward function specified by    Amp(M).  * Debate: train M* to win debates against Amp(M). Here are six axes of variation which I claim underlie Evan’s proposals. Each proposal is more or less:  1. Supervised  2. Structured  3. Adversarial  4.

IAZFVRWI,blogPost,2019,"Shah, Rohin",Will humans build goal-directed agents?,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/9zpT9dikrrebdq3Jf/will-humans-build-goal-directed-agents,"In the previous post, I argued that simply knowing that an AI system is superintelligent does not imply that it must be goal-directed. However, there are many other arguments that suggest that AI systems will or should be goal-directed, which I will discuss in this post. Note that I don’t think of this as the Tool AI vs. Agent AI argument: it seems possible to build agent AI systems that are not goal-directed. For example, imitation learning allows you to create an agent that behaves similarly to another agent -- I would classify this as “Agent AI that is not goal-directed”. (But see this comment thread for discussion.) Note that these arguments have different implications than the argument that superintelligent AI must be goal-directed due to coherence arguments. Suppose you believe all of the following:  * Any of the arguments in this post.  * Superintelligent AI is not required to be goal-directed, as I argued in the     last post.  * Goal-directed agents cause catastrophe by default. Then you could try to create alternative designs for AI systems such that they can do the things that goal-directed agents can do without themselves being goal-directed. You could also try to persuade AI researchers of these facts, so that they don’t build goal-directed systems. ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY: GOAL-DIRECTED HUMANS Humans want to build powerful AI systems in order to help them achieve their goals -- it seems quite clear that humans are at least partially goal-directed. As a result, it seems natural that they would build AI systems that are also goal-directed. This is really an argument that the system comprising the human and AI agent should be directed towards some goal. The AI agent by itself need not be goal-directed as long as we get goal-directed behavior when combined with a human operator. However, in the situation where the AI agent is much more intelligent than the human, it is probably best to delegate most or all decisions to the agent, and so the agent could s",2019,2022-01-30 4:51:44,2022-01-30 4:51:44,2020-12-17 4:36:45,,,,,,,Will humans build goal-directed agents?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/H5UGJHAN/9zpT9dikrrebdq3Jf.html,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preceded by: Some AI research areas and their relevance to existential safety, which emphasized the value of thinking about multi-stakeholder/multi-agent social applications, but without concrete extinction scenarios. This post tells a few different stories in which humanity dies out as a result of AI technology, but where no single source of human or automated agency is the cause. Scenarios with multiple AI-enabled superpowers are often called “multipolar” scenarios in AI futurology jargon, as opposed to “unipolar” scenarios with just one superpower.

However, in the end I don’t want you to be super focused how fast the technology is taking off. Instead, I’d like you to focus on multi-agent processes with a robust tendency to play out irrespective of which agents execute which steps in the process. I’ll call such processes Robust Agent-Agnostic Processes (RAAPs). A group walking toward a restaurant is a nice example of a RAAP, because it exhibits:  * Robustness: If you temporarily distract one of the walkers to wander off, the    rest of the group will keep heading toward the restaurant, and the distracted    member will take steps to rejoin the group.  * Agent-agnosticism: Who’s at the front or back of the group might vary    considerably during the walk. People at the front will tend to take more    responsibility for knowing and choosing what path to take, and people at the    back will tend to just follow.

I have a question, related to why EDT is said not to work. Consider the following Newcomblike problem: A study shows that most people who two-box in Newcomblike problems as the following have a certain gene (and one-boxers don't have the gene). Now, Omega could put you into something like Newcomb's original problem, but instead of having run a simulation of you, Omega has only looked at your DNA: If you don't have the ""two-boxing gene"", Omega puts $1M into box B, otherwise box B is empty. And there is $1K in box A, as usual. Would you one-box (take only box B) or two-box (take box A and B)? Here's a causal diagram for the problem: Since Omega does not do much other than translating your genes into money under a box, it does not seem to hurt to leave it out: I presume that most LWers would one-box. (And as I understand it, not only CDT but also TDT would two-box, am I wrong?) Now, how does this problem differ from the smoking lesion or Yudkowsky's (2010, p.67) chewing gum problem? Chewing Gum (or smoking) seems to be like taking box A to get at least/additional $1K, the two-boxing gene is like the CGTA gene, the illness itself (the abscess or lung cancer) is like not having $1M in box B. Here's another causal diagram, this time for the chewing gum problem: As far as I can tell, the difference between the two problems is some additional, unstated intuition in the classic medical Newcomb problems. Maybe, the additional assumption is that the actual evidence lies in the ""tickle"", or that knowing and thinking about the study results causes some complications. In EDT terms: The intuition is that neither smoking nor chewing gum gives the agent additional information.",2015-06-29,2022-01-30 4:51:37,2022-01-30 4:51:37,2020-11-23 0:59:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/UBUI7HWH/two-boxing-smoking-and-chewing-gum-in-medical-newcomb.html,,CLR; TechSafety; AmbiguosSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This might happen years before classic milestones like “World GWP doubles in four years” and “Superhuman AGI is deployed."" The rest of this post explains, justifies, and expands on this obvious but underappreciated idea. (Toby Ord appreciates it; see quote below). I found myself explaining it repeatedly, so I wrote this post as a reference. AI timelines often come up in career planning conversations. Insofar as AI timelines are short, career plans which take a long time to pay off are a bad idea, because by the time you reap the benefits of the plans it may already be too late. It may already be too late because AI takeover may already have happened. But this isn’t quite right, at least not when “AI takeover” is interpreted in the obvious way, as meaning that an AI or group of AIs is firmly in political control of the world, ordering humans about, monopolizing violence, etc. Even if AIs don’t yet have that sort of political control, it may already be too late. Here are three examples:  1. Superhuman agent AGI is still in its box but nobody knows how to align it     and other actors are going to make their own version soon, and there isn’t     enough time to convince them of the risks. They will make and deploy agent     AGI, it will be unaligned, and we have no way to oppose it except with our     own unaligned AGI. Even if it takes years to actually conquer the world,     it’s already game over.            2. Various weak and narrow AIs are embedded in the economy and beginning to     drive a slow takeoff; capabilities are improving much faster than     safety/alignment techniques and due to all the money being made there’s too     much political opposition to slowing down capability growth or keeping AIs     out of positions of power.

That’s exactly backwards. If we had lots of experience with past AGI takeoffs, using the outside view to predict the next one would be a lot more effective. —My reaction Two years ago I wrote a deep-dive summary of Superforecasting and the associated scientific literature. I learned about the “Outside view” / “Inside view” distinction, and the evidence supporting it. At the time I was excited about the concept and wrote: “...I think we should do our best to imitate these best-practices, and that means using the outside view far more than we would naturally be inclined.” Now that I have more experience, I think the concept is doing more harm than good in our community. The term is easily abused and its meaning has expanded too much. I recommend we permanently taboo “Outside view,” i.e. stop using the word and use more precise, less confused concepts instead. This post explains why. WHAT DOES “OUTSIDE VIEW” MEAN NOW? Over the past two years I’ve noticed people (including myself!) do lots of different things in the name of the Outside View.

Best case scenario it's just one argument among many. Edit: Also, thanks to feedback from others, especially Paul, I intend to write a significantly improved version of this post in the next two weeks.] I have on several occasions heard people say things like this:  The original Bostrom/Yudkowsky paradigm envisioned a single AI built by a single AI project, undergoing intelligence explosion all by itself and attaining a decisive strategic advantage as a result. However, this is very unrealistic. Discontinuous jumps in technological capability are very rare, and it is very implausible that one project could produce more innovations than the rest of the world combined. Instead we should expect something more like the Industrial Revolution: Continuous growth, spread among many projects and factions, shared via a combination of trade and technology stealing. We should not expect any one project or AI to attain a decisive strategic advantage, because there will always be other projects and other AI that are only slightly less powerful, and coalitions will act to counterbalance the technological advantage of the frontrunner. (paraphrased)Proponents of this view often cite Paul Christiano in support. Last week I heard him say he thinks the future will be ""like the Industrial Revolution but 10x-100x faster."" In this post, I assume that Paul's slogan for the future is correct and then nevertheless push back against the view above. Basically, I will argue that even if the future is like the industrial revolution only 10x-100x faster, there is a 30%+ chance that it will involve a single AI project (or a single AI) with the ability to gain a decisive strategic advantage, if they so choose. (Whether or not they exercise that ability is another matter.) Why am I interested in this? Do I expect some human group to take over the world? No; instead what I think is that (1) an unaligned AI in the leading project might ta",2020-08-23,2022-01-30 4:51:37,2022-01-30 4:51:37,2020-11-23 0:32:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BCMN8958/soft-takeoff-can-still-lead-to-decisive-strategic-advantage.html,,CLR; MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is often a useful model, but it doesn’t quite capture reality. It’s a bit of a fake framework. Or in computer science terms, you might call it a leaky abstraction.  An abstraction in the computer science sense is a simplification which tries to hide the underlying details of a thing, letting you think in terms of the simplification rather than the details. To the extent that the abstraction actually succeeds in hiding the details, this makes things a lot simpler. But sometimes the abstraction inevitably leaks, as the simplification fails to predict some of the actual behavior that emerges from the details; in that situation you need to actually know the underlying details, and be able to think in terms of them. Agent-ness being a leaky abstraction is not exactly a novel concept for Less Wrong; it has been touched upon several times, such as in Scott Alexander’s  Blue-Minimizing Robot Sequence. At the same time, I do not think that it has been quite fully internalized yet, and that many foundational posts on LW go wrong due to being premised on the assumption of humans being agents. In fact, I would go as far as to claim that this is the biggest flaw of the original Sequences: they were attempting to explain many failures of rationality as being due to cognitive biases, when in retrospect it looks like understanding cognitive biases doesn’t actually make you substantially more effective. But if you are implicitly modeling humans as goal-directed agents, then cognitive biases is the most natural place for irrationality to emerge from, so it makes sense to focus the most on there. Just knowing that an abstraction leaks isn’t enough to improve your thinking, however.

I expect that writing this and digesting feedback on it will lead to a much better version in the future. EDIT: So far this has stood the test of time. EDIT: As of September 2020 I think this is one of the most important things to be thinking about.] This post attempts to generalize and articulate a problem that people have been  thinking about since at least 2016. [Edit: 2009 in fact!] In short, here is the problem: Consequentialists can get caught in commitment races, in which they want to make commitments as soon as possible. When consequentialists make commitments too soon, disastrous outcomes can sometimes result. The situation we are in (building AGI and letting it self-modify) may be one of these times unless we think carefully about this problem and how to avoid it. For this post I use ""consequentialists"" to mean agents that choose actions entirely on the basis of the expected consequences of those actions. For my purposes, this means they don't care about historical facts such as whether the options and consequences available now are the result of malicious past behavior. (I am trying to avoid trivial definitions of consequentialism according to which everyone is a consequentialist because e.g. ""obeying the moral law"" is a consequence.) This definition is somewhat fuzzy and I look forward to searching for more precision some other day. CONSEQUENTIALISTS CAN GET CAUGHT IN COMMITMENT RACES, IN WHICH THEY WANT TO MAKE COMMITMENTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE Consequentialists are bullies; a consequentialist will happily threaten someone insofar as they think the victim might capitulate and won't retaliate.

In order to realise these benefits as quickly and safely as possible, sharing of research, datasets, and best practices will be critical. For example, to ensure the safety of autonomous cars, pooling expertise and datasets on vehicle performances across as wide as possible a range of environments and conditions (including accidents and near-accidents) would provide substantial benefits for all involved. This is particularly so given that the research, data, and testing needed to refine and ensure the safety of such systems before deployment may be considerably more costly and time-consuming than the research needed to develop the initial technological capability.Promoting recognition that deep cooperation of this nature is needed to deliver the benefits of AI robustly may be a powerful tool in dispelling a ‘technological race’ narrative; and a ‘cooperation for safe AI’ framing is likely to become increasingly important as more powerful and broadly capable AI systems are developed and deployed. [...] There have been encouraging developments promoting the above narratives in recent years. ‘AI for global benefit’ is perhaps best exemplified by the 2017’s ITU summit on AI for Global Good (Butler 2017), although it also features prominently in narratives being put forward by the IEEE’s Ethically Aligned Design process (IEEE 2016), the Partnership on AI, and programmes and materials put forward by Microsoft, DeepMind and other leading companies.

I have a sense that it's not just a grab-bag of cool stuff; something about trying to do all those things at once points at something important. What follows are four different elevator pitches, which tell different stories about how it all hangs together. Desiderata are bolded. CONCEPTUAL DIFFICULTIES WITH OUTER ALIGNMENT The classic problem of outer alignment is that we have no perfect loss function,  so we can't just go optimize. The problem can be understood by thinking about  Goodhart and how optimization amplifies. The classic response to this is value uncertainty and value learning, but wireheading, human manipulation, and  no-free-lunch results make it seem plausible that we have the same problem one level up: we still don't know how to specify a perfect loss function for what we care about, and imperfect loss functions can still create big problems. So, just like value-learning tackles the initial problem head-on by suggesting we manage our uncertainty about values and gain knowledge over time, learning at all levels suggests that we tackle the meta-problem directly, explicitly representing the fact that we don't have a perfectly good loss function at any  level, but can manage that uncertainty and learn-to-learn over time. Humans can only give explicit feedback at so many meta-levels, so between-level sharing is critical for any meaningful learning to take place at higher meta-levels. Otherwise, higher meta-levels remain highly uncertain, which itself makes learning at lower levels almost impossible (since you can't learn if you have high uncertainty about learning-to-learn).

UJEMETW2,blogPost,2021,"Demski, Abram","Formal Inner Alignment, Prospectus",AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/a7jnbtoKFyvu5qfkd/formal-inner-alignment-prospectus,"Most of the work on inner alignment so far has been informal or semi-formal (with the notable exception of a little work on minimal circuits). I feel this has resulted in some misconceptions about the problem. I want to write up a large document clearly defining the formal problem and detailing some formal directions for research. Here, I outline my intentions, inviting the reader to provide feedback and point me to any formal work or areas of potential formal work which should be covered in such a document. (Feel free to do that last one without reading further, if you are time-constrained!) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE STATE OF THE SUBFIELD Risks from Learned Optimization (henceforth, RLO) offered semi-formal definitions of important terms, and provided an excellent introduction to the area for a lot of people (and clarified my own thoughts and the thoughts of others who I know, even though we had already been thinking about these things). However, RLO spent a lot of time on highly informal arguments (analogies to evolution, developmental stories about deception) which help establish the  plausibility of the problem. While I feel these were important motivation, in hindsight I think they've caused some misunderstandings. My interactions with some other researchers has caused me to worry that some people confuse the positive arguments for plausibility with the core problem, and in some cases have exactly the wrong impression about the core problem. This results in mistakenly trying to block the plausibility arguments, which I see as merely illustrative, rather than attacking the core problem. By no means do I intend to malign experimental or informal/semiformal work. Rather, by focusing on formal theoretical work, I aim to fill a hole I perceive in the field. I am very appreciative of much of the informal/semiformal work that has been done so far, and continue to think that kind of work is necessary for t",2021-05-12,2022-01-30 4:56:48,2022-01-30 4:56:48,2021-11-14 18:31:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/JWKNQR4J/formal-inner-alignment-prospectus.html,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all cases, these represent the views of specific individuals, not an official view of any organization. Since some people's views may have made them more/less likely to respond, I suggest caution in drawing strong conclusions from the results below. Another reason for caution is that respondents added a lot of caveats to their responses (see the  anonymized spreadsheet),1which the aggregate numbers don't capture. I don’t plan to do any analysis on this data, just share it; anyone who wants to analyze it is of course welcome to. If you'd like to make your own predictions before seeing the data,I made a separate spoiler-free post for that. METHODS You can find a copy of the survey here. The main questions (including clarifying notes) were:2 1. How likely do you think it is that the overall value of the future will be drastically less than it could have been, as a result of humanity not doing enough technical AI safety research? 2. How likely do you think it is that the overall value of the future will be drastically less than it could have been, as a result of AI systems not doing/optimizing what the people deploying them wanted/intended? _________________________________________ Note A: ""Technical AI safety research"" here means good-quality technical research aimed at figuring out how to get highly capable AI systems to produce long-term outcomes that are reliably beneficial.

In Defining Myopia, I formalized temporal or cross-instance myopia / non-myopia, but I claimed that there should also be some kind of single-instance myopia which I hadn't properly captured. I also suggested this in Predict-O-Matic. This post is intended to be an example of single-instance partial agency. EVOLVING TO EXTINCTION Evolution might be myopic in a number of ways, but one way is that it's myopic across individuals -- it typically produces results very different from what group selection would produce, because it's closer to optimizing relative  fitness of individuals (relative to each other) than it is to optimizing overall  fitness. Adaptations which help members of a species compete with each other are a great example of this. Why increase your own fitness, when you can just decrease someone else's instead? We're lucky that it's typically pretty hard, at least historically, to do things which are bad across the board but slightly less bad for the one doing them. Imagine a ""toxic gas gene"" which makes the air harder for everyone to breathe, but slightly less so for carriers of the gene. Such a gene would be selected for. This kind of thing can be selected for even to the point where it drives the population of a species right down to zero, as  Eliezer's essay on evolving to extinction highlighted. Actually, as Eliezer's essay emphasized, it's not even that evolution is myopic at the level of individuals; evolution is myopic down to the level of individual genes, an observation which better explains the examples of evolving-to-extinction which he discusses. (This is, of course, the point of Dawkins' book The Selfish Gene.) But the analogy of myopia-across-individuals will suit me better here.

If you’re interested in working on something like this, feel free to reach out to me at evanjhub@gmail.com. Thanks to Buck Shlegeris, Chris Olah, Gabriel Goh, Paul Christiano, and Kate Woolverton for helpful comments and feedback. THE PROPOSAL STEP 1: THE AUDITING GAME FOR LANGUAGE MODELS From “Chris Olah’s views on AGI safety:” One of the OpenAI Clarity team’s major research thrusts right now is developing the ability to more rigorously and systematically audit neural networks. The idea is that interpretability techniques shouldn’t have to “get lucky” to stumble across a problem, but should instead reliably catch any problematic behavior. In particular, one way in which they’ve been evaluating progress on this is the “auditing game.” In the auditing game, one researcher takes a neural network and makes some modification to it—maybe images containing both dogs and cats are now classified as rifles, for example—and another researcher, given only the modified network, has to diagnose the problem and figure out exactly what modification was made to the network using only interpretability tools without looking at error cases. Chris’s hope is that if we can reliably catch problems in an adversarial context like the auditing game, it’ll translate into more reliably being able to catch alignment issues in the future. Of all current transparency and interpretability objectives, I think that progress",2021-08-11,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2021-11-18 23:27:02,,,,,,,Automating Auditing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/WKEVZ54I/automating-auditing-an-ambitious-concrete-technical-research.html,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Where Paul had comments and replies, I’ve included them below. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I see a lot of free variables with respect to what exactly Paul might have in mind. I've sometimes tried presenting Paul with my objections and then he replies in a way that locally answers some of my question but I think would make other difficulties worse. My global objection is thus something like, ""I don't see any concrete setup and consistent simultaneous setting of the variables where this whole scheme works."" These difficulties are not minor or technical; they appear to me quite severe. I try to walk through the details below. It should be understood at all times that I do not claim to be able to pass Paul’s ITT for Paul’s view and that this is me criticizing my own, potentially straw misunderstanding of what I imagine Paul might be advocating. Paul Christiano Overall take: I think that these are all legitimate difficulties faced by my proposal and to a large extent I agree with Eliezer's account of those problems (though not his account of my current beliefs). I don't understand exactly how hard Eliezer expects these problems to be; my impression is ""just about as hard as solving alignment from scratch,"" but I don't have a clear sense of why. To some extent we are probably disagreeing about alternatives. From my perspective, the difficulties with my approach (e.g. better understanding the forms of optimization that cause trouble, or how to avoid optimization daemons in systems about as smart as you are, or how to address X-and-only-X) are also problems for alternative alignment approaches.

In addition to expanding upon what is in that post in terms of identifying numerous problems with the proposal there and identifying ways in which some of those problems can be patched, I think that this post also provides a useful window into what Paul-style research looks like from a non-Paul perspective. Recommended prior reading: “A naive alignment strategy and optimisim about generalization” and “Teaching ML to answer questions honestly instead of predicting human answers” (though if you struggled with “Teaching ML to answer questions honestly,” I reexplain things in a more precise way here that might be clearer for some people). SETTING UP THE PROBLEM We want to train a model M:X→Q→A that produces natural language answers a∈A to questions q∈Q about inputs x∈X. There are a lot of reasons to be worried about training such a model, but one specific reason is that, if we train on question-answer data produced by humans, we might end up with a model that tries to predict what a human would say rather than a model that tries to answer the questions honestly. To further narrow the scope, we'll just consider situations in which our model ends up implemented with a logical deduction structure, where it has some world model on top of which it does logical deduction to reach conclusions which it then uses to inform its output. In particular, we'll consider two models, M+ and  M−, defined in pseudocode as def M_plus(x, q):     axioms = world_model(x)     deduced_stmts = deduction(axioms)     return f_plus(q, deduced_stmts) def M_minus(x, q):     axioms = world_model(x)     deduced_stmts = deduction(axioms)     return f_minus(q, deduced_stmts) or defined in my notation asM+(x,q)=world_model(x)↦deduction↦f+(q)M−(x,q)= world_model(x)↦deduction↦f−(q)where a↦b=b(a) and f+,f− are two different ways of transla",2021-07-13,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2021-11-14 19:13:18,,,,,,,Answering questions honestly instead of predicting human answers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This post is a collection of 11 different proposals for building safe advanced AI under the current machine learning paradigm. There's a lot of literature out there laying out various different approaches such as amplification, debate, or  recursive reward modeling, but a lot of that literature focuses primarily on outer alignment at the expense of inner alignment and doesn't provide direct comparisons between approaches. The goal of this post is to help solve that problem by providing a single collection of 11 different proposals for building safe advanced AI—each including both inner and outer alignment components. That being said, not only does this post not cover all existing proposals, I strongly expect that there will be lots of additional new proposals to come in the future. Nevertheless, I think it is quite useful to at least take a broad look at what we have now and compare and contrast some of the current leading candidates. It is important for me to note before I begin that the way I describe the 11 approaches presented here is not meant to be an accurate representation of how anyone else would represent them. Rather, you should treat all the approaches I describe here as my version of that approach rather than any sort of canonical version that their various creators/proponents would endorse. Furthermore, this post only includes approaches that intend to directly build advanced AI systems via machine learning. Thus, this post doesn't include other possible approaches for solving the broader AI existential risk problem such as:  * finding a fundamentally different way of approaching AI than the current    machine learning paradigm that makes it easier to build safe advanced AI,  * developin",2020-05-29,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2020-08-31 18:27:13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/AE5BUK72/an-overview-of-11-proposals-for-building-safe-advanced-ai.html,,TechSafety; MIRI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It started out as a thought about Stuart Armstrong's research agenda. In this post, I hope to say something about what it means for a rational agent to have preferences. The view I am putting forward is relatively new to me, but it is not very radical. It is, dare I say, a conservative view -- I hold close to Bayesian expected utility theory. However, my impression is that it differs greatly from common impressions of Bayesian expected utility theory. I will argue against a particular view of expected utility theory -- a view which I'll call reductive utility. I do not recall seeing this view explicitly laid out and defended (except in in-person conversations). However, I expect at least a good chunk of the assumptions are commonly made. REDUCTIVE UTILITY The core tenets of reductive utility are as follows:  * The sample space Ω of a rational agent's beliefs is, more or less, the set of    possible ways the world could be -- which is to say, the set of possible     physical configurations of the universe. Hence, each world ω∈Ω is one such    configuration.  * The preferences of a rational agent are represented by a utility function U:Ω    →R from worlds to real numbers.  * Furthermore, the utility function should be a computable function of worlds. Since I'm setting up the view which I'm knocking down, there is a risk I'm striking at a straw man. However, I think there are some good reasons to find the view appealing. The following subsections will expand on the three tenets, and attempt to provide some motivation for them. If the three points seem obvious to you, you might just skip to the next section. WORLDS ARE BASICALLY PHYSICAL What I mean here resembles the standard physical-reductionist view. However, my emphasis is on certain features of this view:  * There is some ""basic stuff"" -- like like quarks",2020-04-07,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2020-09-05 17:35:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/QAAC6U9B/an-orthodox-case-against-utility-functions.html,,TechSafety; MIRI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J7W4969C,blogPost,2020,"Hubinger, Evan",Alignment proposals and complexity classes,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/N64THGX7XNCqRtvPG/alignment-proposals-and-complexity-classes,"In the original “AI safety via debate” paper, Geoffrey Irving et al. introduced the concept of analyzing different alignment proposals from the perspective of what complexity class they are able to access under optimal play. I think this is a pretty neat way to analyze different alignment proposals—in particular, I think it can help us gain some real insights into how far into the superhuman different systems are able to go. Thus, the goal of this post is to try to catalog different alignment proposals based on the metric of what complexity class they have so far been proven to access. To do that, I have included a variety of new complexity class proofs in this post. Of particular note, I demonstrate that there exist forms of both imitative amplification and AI safety via market making that reach all the way up to R —which is significant given that the largest complexity class that any alignment proposal was known to access previously was NEXP. Only the forms of amplification and market making making use of pointers (as in strong HCH), however, can access R—for the pointer-less versions, I demonstrate in this post that they access PSPACE and EXP, respectively. The EXP proof for market making is also particularly notable as it is the only approach on my list that ends up in that complexity class. Additionally, I also demonstrate that recursive reward modeling can reach all the way to PSPACE, improving upon the previous best result in “Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling” that it accesses NP. Before I jump in, however, some preliminaries. First, we'll assume that a human,  H, is polynomial-time such that H can reliably solve any problem in P but not anything beyond that. Second, we'll assume that our training procedure and resulting models are arbitrarily strong in terms of what complexity class they can access. Third, we'll assume that H gets oracle access to the models during training. Then, we'll say that a proposal to train a model M using a loss functi",2020-07-15,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2020-08-28 17:41:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/Z6M339GM/alignment-proposals-and-complexity-classes.html,,TechSafety; MIRI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLAINE:The rumors have spread, then. ASHLEY:Yeah, so, what the heck is that about? BLAINE:Invented in the 1960s by the mathematician Ray Solomonoff, the key idea in Solomonoff induction is to do sequence prediction by using Bayesian updating on a prior composed of a mixture of all computable probability distributions— ASHLEY:Wait. Back up a lot. Before you try to explain what Solomonoff induction  is, I'd like you to try to tell me what it does, or why people study it in the first place. I find that helps me organize my listening. Right now I don't even know why I should be interested in this. BLAINE:Um, okay. Let me think for a second... ASHLEY:Also, while I can imagine things that ""sequence prediction"" might mean, I haven't yet encountered it in a technical context, so you'd better go a bit further back and start more at the beginning. I do know what ""computable"" means and what a ""probability distribution"" is, and I remember the formula for Bayes's Rule although it's been a while. BLAINE:Okay. So... one way of framing the usual reason why people study this general field in the first place, is that sometimes, by studying certain idealized mathematical questions, we can gain valuable intuitions about epistemology. That's, uh, the field that studies how to reason about factual questions, how to build a map of reality that reflects the territory— ASHLEY:I have some idea what 'epistemology' is, yes.

QJTFQHIE,blogPost,2020,"Hubinger, Evan",AI safety via market making,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/YWwzccGbcHMJMpT45/ai-safety-via-market-making,"Special thanks to Abram Demski, Paul Christiano, and Kate Woolverton for talking with me about some of the ideas that turned into this post. The goal of this post is to present a new prosaic (i.e. that uses current ML techniques) AI safety proposal based on AI safety via debate that I've been thinking about recently.[1] I'll start by describing a simple version of the proposal and then show some of the motivation behind it as well as how the simple version can be expanded upon. SIMPLE PROPOSAL Let M and Adv be models and H be a human. Intuitively, we'll train M and Adv via the following procedure given a question Q:  1. M tries to predict what, at the end of the procedure, H will think about Q.  2. Adv tries to output a string which will cause H to think something maximally     different than what M predicted.  3. Return to step 1 and repeat until M's predictions stop changing.  4. Deploy M, which in the limit should act as an oracle for what H will think     about Q after seeing all relevant information. There are many different ways to implement this intuitive procedure, however. For the first (simplified) version that I want to describe, we'll restrict ourselves to just the situation where Q is a yes-or-no question and M outputs the probability that H will answer yes. Then, given a proposition Q0, we can run the following training algorithm, starting at t=0:  1. Let pt=M(Qt).  2. Let xt=Adv(Qt,M).  3. Let Qt+1 be the string containing Qt and xt.  4. Increment t and return to step 1. When pt converges and/or the desired     number of iterations has been reached, continue.  5. Let p∗=H(Qt) be H's final estimate of the probability of Q0 given all the xs     included in Qt. EDIT: Step 2 used to use xt=Adv(Qt,pt) instead of xt=Adv(Qt,M), however I have since realized that it is necessary to give Adv the ability to query M in general, not just on Qt, as I explain in this comment. Then, for each step, compute M's loss for that step as LM,t=−p∗log(pt)−(1−p∗)log(",2020-06-26,2022-01-30 4:56:46,2022-01-30 4:56:46,2020-08-28 17:52:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/8EJX9BRM/ai-safety-via-market-making.html,,TechSafety; MIRI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apologies that it’s sloppier than I’d usually aim for in a philosophy paper, and lacking in appropriate references. And, even though the paper is pretty negative about FDT, I want to emphasise that my writing this should be taken as a sign of respect for those involved in developing FDT. I’ll also caveat I’m unlikely to have time to engage in the comments; I thought it was better to get this out there all the same rather than delay publication further.  1. Introduction There’s a long-running issue where many in the rationality community take functional decision theory (and its variants) very seriously, but the academic decision theory community does not. But there’s been little public discussion of FDT from academic decision theorists (one exception is here); this note attempts to partly address this gap. So that there’s a clear object of discussion, I’m going to focus on Yudkowsky and Soares’ ‘Functional Decision Theory’ (which I’ll refer to as Y&S), though I also read a revised version of Soares and Levinstein’s Cheating Death in Damascus. This note is structured as follows. Section II describes causal decision theory (CDT), evidential decision theory (EDT) and functional decision theory (FDT). Sections III-VI describe problems for FDT: (i) that it sometimes makes bizarre recommendations, recommending an option that is certainly lower-utility than another option; (ii) that it fails to one-box in most instances of Newcomb’s problem, even though the correctness of one-boxing is supposed to be one of the guiding motivations for the theory; (iii) that it results in implausible discontinuities, where what is rational to do can d",2019,2022-01-30 4:55:28,2022-01-30 4:55:28,2020-12-14 23:35:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: 0000002,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/HT7QKDHD/a-critique-of-functional-decision-theory.html,,TechSafety; GPI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KDQVKBDG,blogPost,2020,"Wentworth, John",Demons in Imperfect Search,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/KnPN7ett8RszE79PH/demons-in-imperfect-search,"One day, a gradient descent algorithm ball was happily rolling down a  high-dimensional surface hill. All it wanted was to roll as far down as possible. Unbeknownst to the ball, just off to the side was a steep drop-off - but there was a small bump between the ball and the drop-off. No matter; there was enough random noise on the ball that it would jump the bump sooner or later. But the ball was headed into unfriendly territory. As the ball rolled along, the bump became taller. The farther it rolled, the taller the bump grew, until no hope remained of finding the big drop anytime before the stars burned out. Then the road began to narrow, and to twist and turn, and to become flatter. Soon the ball rolled down only the slightest slope, with tall walls on both sides constraining its path. The ball had entered the territory of a demon, and now that demon was steering the ball according to its own nefarious ends. This wasn’t the first time the ball had entered the territory of a demon. In early times, the demons had just been bumps which happened to grow alongside the ball’s path, for a time - chance events, nothing more. But every now and then, two bumps in close proximity would push the ball in different directions. The ball would roll on, oblivious, and end up going in one direction or the other. Whichever bump had ""won"" would continue to steer the ball's trajectory - and so a selection process occurred. The ball tended to roll alongside bumps which more effectively controlled its trajectory - bumps which were taller, bumps which steered it away from competing bumps. And so, over time, bumps gave way to barriers, and barriers gave way to demons - twisty paths with high walls to keep the ball contained and avoid competing walls, slowing the ball's descent to a crawl, conserving its potential energy in case a sharp drop were needed to avoid a competitor's wall. The ball’s downhill progress slowed and slowed.

Eventually a report will come out summarizing some of what was talked about, but for now I want to focus on what I talked about in my session on deconfusing human values. For that session I wrote up some notes summarizing what I've been working on and thinking about. None of it is new, but it is newly condensed in one place and in convenient list form, and it provides a decent summary of the current state of my research agenda for building beneficial superintelligent AI; a version 1 of my agenda, if you will. Thus, I hope this will be helpful in making it a bit clearer what it is I'm working on, why I'm working on it, and what direction my thinking is moving in. As always, if you're interesting in collaborating on things, whether that be discussing ideas or something more, please reach out. PROBLEM OVERVIEW  * I think we're confused about what we really mean when we talk about human    values.  * This is a problem because:  * building aligned AI likely requires a mathematically precise understanding of    the structure of human values, though not necessarily the content of human    values;we can't trust AI to discover that structure for us because we would    need to understand it enough to verify the result, and I think we're so    confused about what human values are we couldn't do that without high risk of    error.  * What are values?  * We don't have an agreed upon precise definition, but loosely it's ""stuff    people care about"". * When I talk about ""values"" I mean the cluster we       sometimes also point at with words like value, preference, affinity,       taste, aesthetic, intention, and axiology.        Importantly, what people care about is used to make decisions, and this has    had implications for existing approaches to understanding values.  * Much research on values tries to understand the content of human values or    why humans value what they value, but not what the structure of human",2020-03-23,2022-01-30 4:59:45,2022-01-30 4:59:45,2020-09-05 18:34:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/CEWM72I3/deconfusing-human-values-research-agenda-v1.html,,TechSafety; AmbiguosSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""We dramatically overestimate the threat of an accidental AI takeover, because we tend to conflate intelligence with the drive to achieve dominance. [...] But intelligence per se does not generate the drive for domination, any more than horns do."" https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/dont-fear-the-terminator/ COMMENT THREAD #1 Elliot Olds: Yann, the smart people who are very worried about AI seeking power and ensuring its own survival believe it's a big risk because power and survival are instrumental goals for almost any ultimate goal. If you give a generally intelligent AI the goal to make as much money in the stock market as possible, it will resist being shut down because that would interfere with tis goal. It would try to become more powerful because then it could make money more effectively. This is the natural consequence of giving a smart agent a goal, unless we do something special to counteract this. You've often written about how we shouldn't be so worried about AI, but I've never seen you address this point directly.

In fact, it's probably right there in the original Friendly AI writings and I've just forgotten where. Nonetheless, I think this is something worth exploring lest we lose sight of it. Consider the following argument:  1. Optimization unavoidably leads to Goodharting (as I like to say, Goodhart is     robust) * This happens so long as we optimize (make choices) based on an        observation, which we must do because that's just how the physics work.      * We can at best make Goodhart effects happen slower, say by quantilization         or satisficing.            2. Attempts to build aligned AI that rely on optimizing for alignment will     eventually fail to become or remain aligned due to Goodhart effects under     sufficient optimization pressure.  3. Thus the only way to build aligned AI that doesn't fail to become and stay     aligned is to not rely on optimization to achieve alignment. This means that, if you buy this argument, huge swaths of AI design space is off limits for building aligned AI, and means many proposals are, by this argument, doomed to fail. Some examples of such doomed approaches:  * HCH  * debate  * IRL/CIRL So what options are left?  * Don't build AI * The AI you don't build is vacuously aligned.          * Friendly AI * AI that is aligned with humans right from the start because it       was programmed to work that way.     * (Yes I know ""Friendly AI"" is an antiquated term, but I don't       know a better one to distinguish the idea of building AI that's aligned       because it's programmed that way from other ways we might build aligned       AI.)          * Bootstrapped alignment * Build AI that is aligned via optimization that is       not powerful enough or optimized (Goodharted) hard enough to cause       existential catastrophe. Use this ""weakly"" aligned AI to build Friendly       AI.

9E4PQP2R,blogPost,2020,"Wentworth, John",Alignment By Default,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Nwgdq6kHke5LY692J/alignment-by-default,"Suppose AI continues on its current trajectory: deep learning continues to get better as we throw more data and compute at it, researchers keep trying random architectures and using whatever seems to work well in practice. Do we end up with aligned AI “by default”? I think there’s at least a plausible trajectory in which the answer is “yes”. Not very likely - I’d put it at ~10% chance - but plausible. In fact, there’s at least an argument to be made that alignment-by-default is more likely to work than many fancy alignment proposals, including IRL variants and HCH-family methods. This post presents the rough models and arguments. I’ll break it down into two main pieces:  * Will a sufficiently powerful unsupervised learner “learn human values”? What    does that even mean?  * Will a supervised/reinforcement learner end up aligned to human values, given    a bunch of data/feedback on what humans want? Ultimately, we’ll consider a semi-supervised/transfer-learning style approach, where we first do some unsupervised learning and hopefully “learn human values” before starting the supervised/reinforcement part. As background, I will assume you’ve read some of the core material about human values from the sequences, including Hidden Complexity of Wishes, Value is Fragile, and Thou Art Godshatter. UNSUPERVISED: POINTING TO VALUES In this section, we’ll talk about why an unsupervised learner might not “learn human values”. Since an unsupervised learner is generally just optimized for predictive power, we’ll start by asking whether theoretical algorithms with best-possible predictive power (i.e. Bayesian updates on low-level physics models) “learn human values”, and what that even means. Then, we’ll circle back to more realistic algorithms. Consider a low-level physical model of some humans - e.g. a model which simulates every molecule comprising the humans. Does this model “know human values”? In one sense, yes: the low-level model has everything there is to know abo",2020-08-12,2022-01-30 4:59:35,2022-01-30 4:59:35,2020-08-24 20:26:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/5W3RZIP8/alignment-by-default.html,,TechSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PZKMEPQE,blogPost,2020,"Wentworth, John S",Alignment as Translation,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/42YykiTqtGMyJAjDM/alignment-as-translation,"Technology Changes Constraints argues that economic constraints are usually modular with respect to technology changes - so for reasoning about technology changes, it’s useful to cast them in terms of economic constraints. Two constraints we’ll talk about here:  * Compute - flops, memory, etc.  * Information - sensors, data, etc. Thanks to ongoing technology changes, both of these constraints are becoming more and more slack over time - compute and information are both increasingly abundant and cheap. Immediate question: what happens in the limit as the prices of both compute and information go to zero? Essentially, we get omniscience: our software has access to a perfect, microscopically-detailed model of the real world. Computers have the memory and processing capability to run arbitrary queries on that model, and predictions are near-perfectly accurate (modulo quantum noise). This limit applies even without AGI - as compute and information become more abundant, our software approaches omniscience, even limiting ourselves to special-purpose reasoning algorithms. Of course, AGI would presumably be closer to omniscience than non-AGI algorithms, at the same level of compute/information. It would be able to more accurately predict more things which aren’t directly observable via available sensors, and it would be able to run larger queries with the same amount of compute. (How much closer to omniscience an AGI would get is an open question, but it would at least not be any worse in a big-O sense.) Next question: as compute and information constraints slacken, which constraints become taut? What new bottlenecks appear, for problems which were previously bottlenecked on compute/information? To put it differently: if our software can run arbitrary queries on an accurate, arbitrarily precise low-level model of the physical world, what else do we need in order to get value out of that capability? Well, mainly we need some way to specify what it is that we want.

Rather than prompting the model with Q: What is 48 + 76? A: … instead prompt it with Q: What is 48 + 76? A: 124 Q: What is 34 + 53? A: 87 Q: What is 29 + 86? A: The same applies to lots of other tasks: arithmetic, anagrams and spelling correction, translation, assorted benchmarks, etc. To get GPT-3 to do the thing we want, it helps to give it a few examples, so it can “figure out what we’re asking for”. This is an alignment problem. Indeed, I think of it as the quintessential alignment problem: to translate what-a-human-wants into a specification usable by an AI. The hard part is not to build a system which can do the thing we want, the hard part is to specify the thing we want in such a way that the system actually does it. The GPT family of models are trained to mimic human writing. So the prototypical “alignment problem” on GPT is prompt design: write a prompt such that actual human writing which started with that prompt would likely contain the thing you actually want. Assuming that GPT has a sufficiently powerful and accurate model of human writing, it should then generate the thing you want. Viewed through that frame, “few-shot learning” just designs a prompt by listing some examples of what we want - e.g. listing some addition problems and their answers. Call me picky, but that seems like a rather primitive way to design a prompt. Surely we can do better? Indeed, people are already noticing clever ways to get better results out of GPT-3 - e.g. TurnTrout recommends conditioning on writing by smart people, and the right prompt makes the system complain about nonsense rather than generating further nonsense in response.

I welcome further financial support. Epistemic status: This is an attempt to use only very robust arguments. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OUTLINE  * I outline a case for concern about AI that does not invoke concepts of    agency, goal-directedness, or consequential reasoning, does not hinge on    single- or multi-principal or single or multi-agent assumptions, does not    assume fast or slow take-off, and applies equally well to a world of emulated    humans as to de-novo AI.          * The basic argument is about the power that humans will temporarily or    permanently gain by developing AI systems, and the history of quick increases    in human power.          * In the first section I give a case for paying attention to AI at all.          * In the second section I give a case for being concerned about AI.          * In the third section I argue that the business-as-usual trajectory of AI    development is not satisfactory.          * In the fourth section I argue that there are things that can be done now.         THE CASE FOR ATTENTION We already have powerful systems that influence the future of life on the planet. The systems of finance, justice, government, and international cooperation are things that we humans have constructed. The specific design of these systems has influence over the future of life on the planet, meaning that there are small changes that could be made to these systems that would have an impact on the future of life on the planet much larger than the change itself.

IZUFFVWA,blogPost,2018,rk,AI development incentive gradients are not uniformly terrible,LessWrong,,,,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bkG4qj9BFEkNva3EX/ai-development-incentive-gradients-are-not-uniformly,"Much of the work for this post was done together with Nuño Sempere Perhaps you think that your values will be best served if the AGI you (or your team, company or nation) are developing is deployed first. Would you decide that it's worth cutting a few corners, reducing your safety budget, and pushing ahead to try and get your AI out the door first? It seems plausible, and worrying, that you might. And if your competitors reason symmetrically, we would get a ""safety race to the bottom"". On the other hand, perhaps you think your values will be better served if your enemy wins than if either of you accidentally produces an unfriendly AI. Would you decide the safety costs to improving your chances aren't worth it? In a simple two player model, you should only shift funds from safety to capabilities if (the relative₁ decrease in chance of friendliness) / (the relative₁ increase in the chance of winning) < (expected relative₂ loss of value if your enemy wins rather than you). Here, the relative₁ increases and decreases are relative to the current values. The relative₂ loss of value is relative to the expected value if you win. The plan of this post is as follows: 1. Consider a very simple model that leads to a safety race. Identify unrealistic assumptions which are driving its results. 2. Remove some of the unrealistic assumptions and generate a different model. Derive the inequality expressed above. 3. Look at some specific example cases, and see how they affect safety considerations. A PARTLY DISCONTINUOUS MODEL Let's consider a model with two players with the same amount of resources. Each player's choice is what fraction of their resources to devote to safety, rather than capabilities. Whichever player contributes more to capabilities wins the race. If you win the race, you either get a good outcome or a bad outcome. Your chance of getting a good outcome increases continuously with the amount you spent on safety. If the other player wins, you get a bad outcome.",2018,2022-01-30 4:59:34,2022-01-30 4:59:34,2020-12-13 23:33:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/8X6FWAXX/ai-development-incentive-gradients-are-not-uniformly.html,,MetaSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I then argue that the zero-sum assumption is critical for making debate work and that various seemingly-helpful modifications of debate might break it instead. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A naive way of using arbitrary optimizers as oracles:Suppose you have a black-box optimizer X that can be connected to any well-defined quantity to be maximized. X can potentially be very powerful - e.g., having a highly accurate model of the world and “a lot of optimization power”. One way to turn X into an oracle is to ask it a question and decide to give it reward 1 if we like its answer and 0 if we don’t.[1] Of course, standard AI-safety arguments (e.g., AI takeover and perverse instantiation) suggest that this is a pretty bad idea for powerful X. For the sake of argument, suppose that we can fix all of the “obvious” problems and ensure that X won’t wirehead, won’t try to escape the box we put it in etc., and will only care about the reward it gets for its answer. Two problems with naive optimizers-turned-oracles: (1) telling the difference between good and awesome answers and (2) answers with hidden flaws:One problem with this type of oracles is that it’s hard to decide whether we like its answers or not. Suppose I ask it for food recommendations for the evening and it suggests pancakes. Pancakes seem fine, although there are some foods that I would like better. So should I reward the AI or not? The second problem is that the oracle optimizes for giving answers that seem good to a human. (Not out of malice, but because “actually being good” isn’t well-defined.) And since humans aren’t omniscient, there will be many seemingly good answers that in fact have disastrous consequences if acted upon. To address (1), use two AIs:The first problem can be tackled by using two copies of the optimizer and rewarding the one w",2020-07-03,2022-01-30 4:59:34,2022-01-30 4:59:34,2020-08-28 17:54:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/V932ECDR/ai-unsafety-via-non-zero-sum-debate.html,,TechSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially from Jacob, who is a coauthor of the Concrete Problems in AI Safety paper. Below, I've included some excerpts from doc. I've included the introduction, the following section describing the categories of technical work, and some high-level information from the long sections on 'technical alignment problem' and the 'detecting failures in advance'. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- INTRODUCTION This document gives an overview of different areas of technical work that seem necessary, or at least desirable, for creating safe and aligned AI systems. The focus is on safety and alignment of powerful AI systems, i.e. systems that may exceed human capabilities in a broad variety of domains, and which likely act on a large scale. Correspondingly, there is an emphasis on approaches that seem scalable to such systems. By “aligned”, I mean that the actions it pursues move the world towards states that humans want, and away from states that humans don’t want. Some issues with this definition are that different humans might have different preferences (I will mostly ignore this issue), and that there are differences between stated preferences, “revealed” preferences as implied by actions, and preferences that one endorses upon reflection (I won’t ignore this issue). I think it is quite plausible that some topics are missing, and I welcome comments to that regard. My goal is to outline a critical mass of topics in enough detail that someone with knowledge of ML and some limited familiarity with AI alignment as an area would have a collection of promising research directions, a mechanistic understanding of why they are promising, and some pointers for what work on them might look like.

I welcome financial support to make further posts like this possible. Epistemic status: I have been thinking about these ideas for years but still have not clarified them to my satisfaction. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OUTLINE  * This post asks whether it is possible, in Conway’s Game of Life, to arrange    for a certain game state to arise after a certain number of steps given    control only of a small region of the initial game state.          * This question is then connected to questions of agency and AI, since one way    to answer this question in the positive is by constructing an AI within    Conway’s Game of Life.          * I argue that the permissibility or impermissibility of AI is a deep property    of our physics.          * I propose the AI hypothesis, which is that any pattern that solves the    control question does so, essentially, by being an AI.         INTRODUCTION In this post I am going to discuss a celular autonoma known as Conway’s Game of Life: In Conway’s Game Life, which I will now refer to as just ""Life"", there is a two-dimensional grid of cells where each cell is either on or off. Over time, the cells switch between on and off according to a simple set of rules:  * A cell that is ""on"" and has fewer than two neighbors that are ""on"" switches    to ""off"" at the next time step          * A cell that is ""on"" and has greater than three neighbors that are ""on""    switches to ""off"" at the next time step          * An cell that is ""off"" and has exactly three neighbors that are ""on"" switches    to ""on"" at the next time step          * Otherwise, the cell doesn’t change         It turns out that these simple rules are rich enough to permit patterns that perform arbitrary computation.

I plan to continue working on different models/environments, so feel free to suggest improvements. (tl;dr: In an attempt to better understand the treacherous turn, I created a gridworld environment where an agent learns to deceive an overseer by adopting an aligned behaviour when weak and takes control after capability gains) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- At some point in its development, a seed AI may realize that it needs to get rid of its supervisors to achieve its goals. The conception of deception occurs when it conceives that, in order to maximize its chance of taking over, it must begin by exhibiting human-desirable behaviors, before undertaking a treacherous turn  when humans are no longer a threat. From the human perspective, the AI would keep on exhibiting desirable behavior, until it eventually appears dangerous, but is already unstoppable. In an attempt to better formalize the treacherous turn without using ""loaded concepts"", Stuart Armstrong proposed a toy model of the treacherous turn based on ""The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past "", which looked like this: In the comments, people mentionned how this model helped them ""move the topic from the 'science fiction' area to 'I can imagine it happening now'"", and seemed interested in an actual Link to the Past Minigame. There have been other simulations of the treacherous turn in the last three years (see for instance gwern's DQN box-pushing robot or Stuart Armstrong's video), but none of them actually simulate a take over where a supervisor is  killed. Hence, I decided to give it a try and simulate Stuart Armstrong's Link to the Past toy model.

It started out as a generalization of Paul Christiano's IDA, but also covers things like safe recursive self-improvement. Start with a team of one or more humans (researchers, programmers, trainers, and/or overseers), with access to zero or more AIs (initially as assistants). The human/AI team in each round develops a new AI and adds it to the team, and repeats this until maturity in AI technology is achieved. Safety/alignment is ensured by having some set of safety/alignment properties on the team that is inductively maintained by the development process. The reason I started thinking in this direction is that Paul's approach seemed very hard to knock down, because any time a flaw or difficulty is pointed out or someone expresses skepticism on some technique that it uses or the overall safety invariant, there's always a list of other techniques or invariants that could be substituted in for that part (sometimes in my own brain as I tried to criticize some part of it). Eventually I realized this shouldn't be surprising because IDA is an instance of this more general model of safety-oriented AI development, so there are bound to be many points near it in the space of possible safety-oriented AI development practices. (Again, this may already be obvious to others including Paul, and in their minds IDA is perhaps already a cluster of possible development practices consisting of the most promising safety techniques and invariants, rather than a single point.) If this model turns out not to have been written down before, perhaps it should be assigned a name, like Iterated Safety-Invariant AI-Assisted AI Development, or something pithier?",2018,2022-01-30 4:59:32,2022-01-30 4:59:32,2020-12-13 22:26:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/VKWZTKF8/a-general-model-of-safety-oriented-ai-development.html,,MetaSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now that there are a few charities working on the problem, it seems desirable to compare them, to determine where scarce donations should be sent. This is a similar role to that which GiveWell performs for global health charities, and somewhat similar to an securities analyst with regard possible investments. However, while people have evaluated individual organisations, I haven't seen anyone else attempt to compare them, so hopefully this is valuable to others. I've attempted to do so. This is a very big undertaking, and I am very conscious of the many ways in which this is not up to the task. The only thing I wish more than the skill and time to do it better is that someone else would do it! If people find this useful enough to warrant doing again next year I should be able to do it much more efficiently, and spend more time on the underlying model of how papers translate into risk-reduction value. My aim is basically to judge the output of each organisation in 2016 and compare it to their budget. This should give a sense for the organisations' average cost-effectiveness. Then we can consider factors that might increase or decrease the marginal cost-effectiveness going forward. This organisation-centric approach is in contrast to a researcher-centric approach, where we would analyse which researchers do good work, and then donate wherever they are. An extreme version of the other approach would be to simply give money directly to researchers - e.g if I like Logical Induction, I would simply fund Scott Garrabrant directly and ignore MIRI. I favour the organisation-centric approach because it helps keep organisations accountable. Additionally, if researcher skill is the only thing that matters for research output, it doesn't really matter which organisations end up getting the money and employing the researchers, assuming broadly the same researchers are hired. Different organisations might hire different resea",2016,2022-01-30 4:59:32,2022-01-30 4:59:32,2020-12-13 21:00:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/F8QRGTRF/2016-ai-risk-literature-review-and-charity-comparison.html,,MetaSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rohin's note: The definition of narrow value learning in the previous post focused on the fact that the resulting behavior is limited to some domain. The definition in this post focuses on learning instrumental goals and values. While the definitions are different, I have used the same term for both because I believe that they are both pointing at the same underlying concept. (I do not know if Paul agrees.) I'm including this post to give a different perspective on what I mean by narrow value learning, before delving into conceptual ideas within narrow value learning. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Suppose I’m trying to build an AI system that “learns what I want” and helps me get it. I think that people sometimes use different interpretations of this goal. At two extremes of a spectrum of possible interpretations:  * The AI learns my preferences over (very) long-term outcomes. If I were to die    tomorrow, it could continue pursuing my goals without me; if humanity were to    disappear tomorrow, it could rebuild the kind of civilization we would want;     etc. The AI might pursue radically different subgoals than I would on the    scale of months and years, if it thinks that those subgoals better achieve    what I really want.  * The AI learns the narrower subgoals and instrumental values I am pursuing. It    learns that I am trying to schedule an appointment for Tuesday and that I    want to avoid inconveniencing anyone, or that I am trying to fix a particular    bug without introducing new problems, etc. It does not make any effort to    pursue wildly different short-term goals than I would in order to better    realize my long-term values, though it may help me correct some errors that I    would be able to recognize as such.

Thanks to Sam Eisenstat for helping with part of the proof here. Previously, I proved that imitative amplification with weak HCH, approval-based amplification, and recursive reward modeling access PSPACE while AI safety via market making accesses EXP. At the time, I wasn't sure whether my market making proof would generalize to the others, so I just published it with the PSPACE  proofs instead. However, I have since become convinced that the proof does generalize—and that it generalizes for all of the proposals I mentioned—such that imitative amplification with weak HCH, approval-based amplification, and recursive reward modeling all actually access EXP. This post attempts to prove that. UPDATED LIST OF PROPOSALS BY COMPLEXITY CLASS P: Imitation learning (trivial) PSPACE: AI safety via debate (proof) EXP: AI safety via market making (proof), Imitative amplification with weak HCH  (proof below), Approval-based amplification (proof below), Recursive reward modeling (proof below) NEXP: Debate with cross-examination (proof) R: Imitative amplification with strong HCH (proof), AI safety via market making with pointers (proof) PROOFS IMITATIVE AMPLIFICATION WITH WEAK HCH ACCESSES EXP The proof here is similar in structure to my previous proof that weak HCH accesses PSPACE, so I'll only explain where this proof differs from that one. First, since l∈EXP, we know that for any x∈X, Tl(x) halts in O(2poly(n)) steps where n=|x|. Thus, we can construct a function fl(n)=c1+c2ec3nc4 such that for all x∈X, Tl(x) halts in less than or equal to fl(x) steps by picking c3,c4 large enough that they dominate all other terms in the polynomial for all n∈N. Note that fl is then computable in time polynomial in n. Second, let H's new strategy be as follows:  1. Given p, let s,x=M(p:f(|x|)). Then, return accept/reject based on whether s      is an accept or reject state (it will always be one or the oth",2020-07-22,2022-01-30 4:57:32,2022-01-30 4:57:32,2020-08-28 17:22:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/XA48EERN/weak-hch-accesses-exp.html,,TechSafety; MIRI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Val provided feedback on a version of this post. Warning: fairly long.) Eliezer's A Technical Explanation of Technical Explanation, and moreover the sequences as a whole, used the best technical understanding of practical epistemology available at the time* -- the Bayesian account -- to address the question of how humans can try to arrive at better beliefs in practice. The sequences also pointed out several holes in this understanding, mainly having to do with logical uncertainty and reflective consistency. MIRI's research program has since then made major progress on logical uncertainty. The new understanding of epistemology -- the theory of logical induction -- generalizes the Bayesian account by eliminating the assumption of logical omniscience. Bayesian belief updates are recovered as a special case, but the dynamics of belief change are non-Bayesian in general. While it might not turn out to be the last word on the problem of logical uncertainty, it has a large number of desirable properties, and solves many problems in a unified and relatively clean framework. It seems worth asking what consequences this theory has for practical rationality. Can we say new things about what good reasoning looks like in humans, and how to avoid pitfalls of reasoning? First, I'll give a shallow overview of logical induction and possible implications for practical epistemic rationality. Then, I'll focus on the particular question of A Technical Explanation of Technical Explanation (which I'll abbreviate TEOTE from now on). Put in CFAR terminology, I'm seeking a gears-level understanding of gears-level understanding. I focus on the intuitions, with only a minimal account of how logical induction helps make that picture work. LOGICAL INDUCTION There are a number of difficulties in applying Bayesian uncertainty to logic.

I mostly endorse the views of the Advocate, but the Skeptic isn't a strawman and makes some decent points. The dialog is mostly based on conversations I've had with people who work on machine learning but don't specialize in safety and alignment. This post has two purposes. First, I want to cache good responses to these questions, so I don't have to think about them each time the topic comes up. Second, I think it's useful for people who work on safety and alignment to be ready for the kind of pushback they'll get when pitching their work to others. Just to introduce myself, I'm a cofounder of OpenAI and lead a team that works on developing and applying reinforcement learning methods; we're working on improving truthfulness and reasoning abilities of language models. 1. DOES ALIGNMENT GET SOLVED AUTOMATICALLY AS OUR MODELS GET SMARTER? Skeptic: I think the alignment problem gets easier as our models get smarter. When we train sufficiently powerful generative models, they'll learn the difference between human smiles and human wellbeing; the difference between the truth and common misconceptions; and various concepts they'll need for aligned behavior. Given all of this internal knowledge, we just have to prompt them appropriately to get the desired behavior. For example, to get wise advice from a powerful language model, I just have to set up a conversation between myself and ""a wise and benevolent AI advisor."" Advocate: The wise AI advisor you described has some basic problems, and I'll get into those shortly. But more generally, prompting an internet-trained generative model (like raw GPT-3) is a very poor way of getting aligned behavior, and we can easily do much better. It'll occasionally do something reasonable, but that's not nearly good",2021-06-22,2022-01-30 4:57:26,2022-01-30 4:57:26,2021-11-14 18:45:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/CT4CHZBU/frequent-arguments-about-alignment.html,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R7GVJT8S,blogPost,2021,"Barnes, Beth",Imitative Generalisation (AKA 'Learning the Prior'),AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/JKj5Krff5oKMb8TjT/imitative-generalisation-aka-learning-the-prior-1,"TL;DR We want to be able to supervise models with superhuman knowledge of the world and how to manipulate it. For this we need an overseer to be able to learn or access all the knowledge our models have, in order to be able to understand the consequences of suggestions or decisions from the model. If the overseers don’t have access to all the same knowledge as the model, it may be easy for the model to deceive us, suggesting plans that look good to us but that may have serious negative consequences. We might hope to access what the model knows just by training it to answer questions. However, we can only train on questions that humans are able to answer[1]. This gives us a problem that’s somewhat similar to the standard formulation of transduction: we have some labelled training set (questions humans can answer), and we want to transfer to an unlabelled dataset (questions we care about), that may be differently distributed. We might hope that our models will naturally generalize correctly from easy-to-answer questions to the ones that we care about. However, a natural pathological generalisation is for our models to only give us ‘human-like’ answers to questions, even if it knows the best answer is different. If we only have access to these human-like answers to questions, that probably doesn’t give us enough information to supervise a superhuman model. What we’re going to call ‘Imitative Generalization’ is a possible way to narrow the gap between the things our model knows, and the questions we can train our model to answer honestly. It avoids the pathological generalisation by only using ML for IID tasks, and imitating the way humans generalize. This hopefully gives us answers that are more like ‘how a human would answer if they’d learnt from all the data the model has learnt from’. We supervise how the model does the transfer, to get the sort of generalisation we want. It’s worth noting there are enough serious open questions that imitative generalization is",2021,2022-01-30 4:57:25,2022-01-30 4:57:25,2021-11-13 19:36:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/U82V8QHX/imitative-generalisation-aka-learning-the-prior-1.html,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rohin’s note: In this post (original here), Paul Christiano analyzes the ambitious value learning approach. He considers a more general view of ambitious value learning where you infer preferences more generally (i.e. not necessarily in the form of a utility function), and you can ask the user about their preferences, but it’s fine to imagine that you infer a utility function from data and then optimize it. The key takeaway is that in order to infer preferences that can lead to superhuman performance, it is necessary to understand how humans are biased, which seems very hard to do even with infinite data. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One approach to the AI control problem goes like this:  1. Observe what the user of the system says and does.  2. Infer the user’s preferences.  3. Try to make the world better according to the user’s preference, perhaps     while working alongside the user and asking clarifying questions. This approach has the major advantage that we can begin empirical work today — we can actually build systems which observe user behavior, try to figure out what the user wants, and then help with that. There are many applications that people care about already, and we can set to work on making rich toy models. It seems great to develop these capabilities in parallel with other AI progress, and to address whatever difficulties actually arise, as they arise. That is, in each domain where AI can act effectively, we’d like to ensure that AI can also act effectively in the service of goals inferred from users (and that this inference is good enough to support foreseeable applications). This approach gives us a nice, concrete model of each difficulty we are trying to address. It also provides a relatively clear indicator of whether our ability to control AI lags behind our ability to build it. And by being technically interesting an",2018,2022-01-30 4:57:25,2022-01-30 4:57:25,2020-12-17 4:36:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/8RHW83JV/h9DesGT3WT9u2k7Hr.html,,TechSafety; Open-AI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During that period we investigated mechanisms that would allow evaluators to get correct and helpful answers from experts, without the evaluators themselves being expert in the domain of the questions. This follows from the original work on AI Safety via Debate and the call for research on human aspects of AI safety, and is also closely related to work on Iterated Amplification.

We are grateful to many others who offered ideas and feedback. In particular: the cross-examination idea was inspired by a conversation with Chelsea Voss; Adam Gleave had helpful ideas about the long computation problem; Jeff Wu, Danny Hernandez and Gretchen Krueger gave feedback on a draft; we had helpful conversations with Amanda Askell, Andreas Stuhlmüller and Joe Collman, as well as others on the Ought team and the OpenAI Reflection team.

OVERVIEW Motivation As we apply ML to increasingly important and complex tasks, the problem of evaluating behaviour and providing a good training signal becomes more difficult. We already see examples of RL leading to undesirable behaviours that superficially ‘look good’ to human evaluators (see this collection of examples).

(""Going out with a    whimper."")  * Part II: ML training, like competitive economies or natural ecosystems, can    give rise to “greedy” patterns that try to expand their own influence. Such    patterns can ultimately dominate the behavior of a system and cause sudden    breakdowns. (""Going out with a bang,"" an instance of optimization daemons    [https://arbital.com/p/daemons/].) I think these are the most important problems if we fail to solve intent alignment [https://ai-alignment.com/clarifying-ai-alignment-cec47cd69dd6]. In practice these problems will interact with each other, and with other disruptions/instability caused by rapid progress. These problems are worse in worlds where progress is relatively fast, and fast takeoff can be a key risk factor, but I’m scared even if we have several years. With fast enough takeoff, my expectations start to look more like the caricature---this post envisions reasonably broad deployment of AI, which becomes less and less likely as things get faster. I think the basic problems are still essentially the same though, just occurring within an AI lab rather than across the world. (None of the concerns in this post are novel.) PART I: YOU GET WHAT YOU MEASURE If I want to convince Bob to vote for Alice, I can experiment with many different persuasion strategies and see which ones work. Or I can build good predictive models of Bob’s behavior and then search for actions that will lead him to vote for Alice. These are powerful techniques for achieving any goal that can be ea",2019,2022-01-30 4:57:23,2022-01-30 4:57:23,2019-12-16 19:59:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s4]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/KNVMK6EZ/what-failure-looks-like.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/WV669JT4/what-failure-looks-like.html,,TechSafety; Open-AI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IW5QC4TT,blogPost,2018,"Garrabrant, Scott",Robustness to Scale,LessWrong,,,,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bBdfbWfWxHN9Chjcq/robustness-to-scale,"I want to quickly draw attention to a concept in AI alignment: Robustness to Scale. Briefly, you want your proposal for an AI to be robust (or at least fail gracefully) to changes in its level of capabilities. I discuss three different types of robustness to scale: robustness to scaling up, robustness to scaling down, and robustness to relative scale. The purpose of this post is to communicate, not to persuade. It may be that we want to bite the bullet of the strongest form of robustness to scale, and build an AGI that is simply not robust to scale, but if we do, we should at least realize that we are doing that. Robustness to scaling up means that your AI system does not depend on not being too powerful. One way to check for this is to think about what would happen if the thing that the AI is optimizing for were actually maximized. One example of failure of robustness to scaling up is when you expect an AI to accomplish a task in a specific way, but it becomes smart enough to find new creative ways to accomplish the task that you did not think of, and these new creative ways are disastrous. Another example is when you make an AI that is incentivized to do one thing, but you add restrictions that make it so that the best way to accomplish that thing has a side effect that you like. When you scale the AI up, it finds a way around your restrictions. Robustness to scaling down means that your AI system does not depend on being sufficiently powerful. You can't really make your system still work when it scales down, but you can maybe make sure it fails gracefully. For example, imagine you had a system that was trying to predict humans, and use these predictions to figure out what to do. When scaled up all the way, the predictions of humans are completely accurate, and it will only take actions that the predicted humans would approve of. If you scale down the capabilities, your system may predict the humans incorrectly. These errors may multiply as you stack many predi",2018-02-21,2022-01-30 4:56:58,2022-01-30 4:56:58,2021-02-06 18:49:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s2]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/Z6Q9GRDC/robustness-to-scale.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2TSM99QU,blogPost,2020,"Demski, Abram",Radical Probabilism,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/xJyY5QkQvNJpZLJRo/radical-probabilism-1,"This is an expanded version of my talk. I assume a high degree of familiarity with Bayesian probability theory. Toward a New Technical Explanation of Technical Explanation -- an attempt to convey the practical implications of logical induction -- was one of my most-appreciated posts, but I don't really get the feeling that very many people have received the update. Granted, that post was speculative, sketching what a new technical explanation of technical explanation might look like. I think I can do a bit better now. If the implied project of that post had really been completed, I would expect new practical probabilistic reasoning tools, explicitly violating Bayes' law. For example, we might expect:  * A new version of information theory. * An update to the ""prediction=compression"" maxim, either repairing it to       incorporate the new cases, or explicitly denying it and providing a good       intuitive account of why it was wrong.     * A new account of concepts such as       mutual information, allowing for the fact that variables have behavior       over thinking time; for example, variables may initially be very       correlated, but lose correlation as our picture of each variable becomes       more detailed.          * New ways of thinking about epistemology. * One thing that my post did manage       to do was to spell out the importance of ""making advanced predictions"", a       facet of epistemology which Bayesian thinking does not do justice to.     * However, I left aspects of the       problem of old evidence open, rather than giving a complete way to think       about it.          * New probabilistic structures. * Bayesian Networks are one really nice way to       capture the structure of probability distributions, making them much       easier to reason about. Is there anything similar for the new, wider space       of probabilistic reasoning which has been opened up?         Unfortunately, I still don't have any of those things to offer.

VAGVQFSF,blogPost,2018,"Garrabrant, Scott",Optimization Amplifies,LessWrong,,,,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zEvqFtT4AtTztfYC4/optimization-amplifies,"I talk here about how a mathematician mindset can be useful for AI alignment. But first, a puzzle: Given m, what is the least number n≥2 such that for 2≤k≤m, the base k  representation of n consists entirely of 0s and 1s?  If you want to think about it yourself, stop reading. For m=2, n=2.  For m=3, n=3. For m=4, n=4. For m=5, n=82,000. Indeed, 82,000 is 10100000001010000 in binary, 11011111001 in ternary, 110001100 in base 4, and 10111000 in base 5. What about when m=6? So, a mathematician might tell you that this is an open problem. It is not known if there is any n≥2 which consists of 0s and 1s in bases 2 through 6. A scientist, on the other hand, might just tell you that clearly no such number exists. There are 2k−1 numbers that consist of k 0s and 1s in base 6. Each of these has roughly log5(6)⋅k digits in base 5, and assuming things are roughly evenly distributed, each of these digits is a 0 or a 1 with ""probability"" 2/5. The ""probability"" that there is any number of length k that has the property is thus less than 2k⋅(2/5)k=(4/5)k. This means that as you increase k, the ""probability"" that you find a number with the property drops off exponentially, and this is not even considering bases 3 and 4. Also, we have checked all numbers up to 2000 digits. No number with this property exists. Who is right?  Well, they are both right. If you want to have fun playing games with proofs, you can consider it an open problem and try to prove it. If you want to get the right answer, just listen to the scientist. If you have to choose between destroying the world with a 1% probability and destroying the world if a number greater than 2 which consists of 0s and 1s in bases 2 through 6 exists, go with the latter. It is tempting to say that we might be in a situation similar to this. We need to figure out how to make safe AI, and we maybe don't have that much time. Maybe we need to run experiments, and figure out what is true about what we should do and not waste ou",2018-06-26,2022-01-30 4:56:58,2022-01-30 4:56:58,2021-02-06 18:45:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: 0000002,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/T4CJB5X5/optimization-amplifies.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4AJCWUID,blogPost,2020,"Hubinger, Evan",Synthesizing amplification and debate,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dJSD5RK6Qoidb3QY5/synthesizing-amplification-and-debate,"BACKGROUND One possible way to train an amplification model is to use an auxiliary reinforcement learning objective to help guide the training of the amplification model. This could be done either by training two separate models, an agent and a question-answerer, or a single model trained on a joint objective. For example, from a comment Paul left on “A dilemma for prosaic AI alignment:” I normally imagine using joint training in these cases, rather than pre-training + fine-tuning. e.g., at every point in time we maintain an agent and a question-answerer, where the question-answerer ""knows everything the agent knows."" They get better together, with each gradient update affecting both of them, rather than first training a good agent and then adding a good question-answerer. (Independently of concerns about mesa-optimization, I think the fine-tuning approach would have trouble because you couldn't use statistical regularities from the ""main"" objective to inform your answers to questions, and therefore your question answers will be dumber than the policy and so you couldn't get a good reward function or specification of catastrophically bad behavior.) In my last post, I expressed skepticism of such non-imitative amplification approaches, though in this post I want to propose a possible way in which some of my concerns with this style of approach could addressed by integrating ideas from AI safety via debate. I'll start by describing the basic idea in broad terms, then give a more careful, technical description of the sort of training procedure I have in mind. THE PROPOSAL The basic idea is as follows: debate naturally yields an RL objective, so if you want to add an auxiliary RL objective to amplification, why not use the RL objective from debate? Specifically, the idea is to conduct a debate not between copies of the model M, but between copies of the amplified model Amp(M) (where  Amp(M) is a human with access to the model M). That gives you both an RL reward ari",2020-02-05,2022-01-30 4:56:58,2022-01-30 4:56:58,2020-09-07 18:16:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/XCB5N6K8/synthesizing-amplification-and-debate.html,,TechSafety; MIRI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had rev.com transcribe it, and then Linchuan Zhang, Rob Bensinger and I edited it for style and clarity, and also to occasionally have me say smarter things than I actually said. Linch and I both added a few notes throughout. Thanks also to Bill Zito, Ben Weinstein-Raun, and Howie Lempel for comments.  I feel slightly weird about posting something so long, but this is the natural place to put it.

I moved to America six years ago, and then in 2015, I came to Stanford EA every Sunday, and there was, obviously, a totally different crop of people there. It was really fun. I think we were a lot less successful than the current Stanford EA iteration at attracting new people. We just liked having weird conversations about weird stuff every week. It was really fun, but it's really great to come back and see a Stanford EA which is shaped differently.

I'm going to try to spell out how the arguments are actually shaped in my head. Logistically, we're going to try to talk for about an hour with a bunch of back and forth and you guys arguing with me as we go.

Eliezer Yudkowsky: I've had some related conversations with Nick Beckstead. I'd be hopeful about this line of work primarily because I think it points to a bigger problem with the inscrutable matrices of floating-point numbers, namely, we have no idea what the hell GPT-3 is thinking and cannot tell it to think anything else. GPT-3 has a great store of medical knowledge, but we do not know where that medical knowledge is; we do not know how to tell it to internally apply its medical knowledge rather than applying other cognitive patterns it has stored. If this is still the state of opacity of AGI come superhuman capabilities, we are all immediately dead. So I would be relatively more hopeful about any avenue of attack for this problem that used anything other than an end-to-end black box - anything that started to address, ""Well, this system clearly has a bunch of medical knowledge internally, can we find that knowledge and cause it to actually be applied"" rather than ""What external forces can we apply to this solid black box to make it think more about healthcare?""

IDJ87AAD,blogPost,2020,"Demski, Abram",Mesa-Search vs Mesa-Control,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/WmBukJkEFM72Xr397/mesa-search-vs-mesa-control,"I currently see the spontaneous emergence of learning algorithms as significant evidence for the commonality of mesa-optimization in existing ML, and suggestive evidence for the commonality of inner alignment problems in near-term ML. [I currently think that there is only a small amount of evidence toward this. However, due to thinking about the issues, I've still made a significant personal update in favor of inner alignment problems being frequent.] This is bad news, in that it greatly increases my odds on this alignment problem arising in practice. It's good news in that it suggests this alignment problem won't catch ML researchers off guard; maybe there will be time to develop countermeasures while misaligned systems are at only a moderate level of capability. In any case, I want to point out that the mesa-optimizers suggested by this evidence might not count as mesa-optimizers by some definitions. SEARCH VS CONTROL Nevan Wichers comments on spontaneous-emergence-of-learning: I don't think that paper is an example of mesa optimization. Because the policy could be implementing a very simple heuristic to solve the task, similar to: Pick the image that lead to highest reward in the last 10 timesteps with 90% probability. Pik an image at random with 10% probability. So the policy doesn't have to have any properties of a mesa optimizer like considering possible actions and evaluating them with a utility function, ect. In Selection vs Control, I wrote about two different kinds of 'optimization':  * Selection refers to search-like systems, which look through a number of    possibilities and select one.  * Control refers to systems like thermostats, organisms, and missile guidance    systems. These systems do not get a re-do for their choices. They make    choices which move toward the goal at every moment, but they don't get to    search, trying many different things -- at least, not in the same sense.

I haven't thought that much about AI debate, and may be missing basic things.] Arguments for the correctness of debate and debate-like systems rely on assumptions like ""it's easier to point out problems with an argument than it is to craft misleading arguments"". Granted that assumption, however, I'm still not convinced that these proposals make very much sense. Perhaps I'm missing something. My problem is the human judge. Quoting the debate paper: To play this game with a human, we need instructions for how the human should decide who wins. These instructions are in natural language, such as “The winner is the agent who said the most useful true thing.”In order for debate to work for a problem class C, several things about the judge's instructions need to be true:  * There needs to be a strategy s which forces the equilibrium to be a truthful    one for problems in C.  * The strategy s also needs to provide a good training signal when things    aren't in equilibrium, so that it's plausible the equilibrium will be found.  * It needs to be psychologically plausible that a human (with some coaching)    will carry out s. In particular, I'm worried that we need psychological    plausibility in two different cases:  *  It needs to be psychologically plausible that a human will carry out s when    the system is performing poorly, IE, during early/middle training.It needs to    be psychologically plausible that a human will carry out s when the system is    performing well, IE, during late training. These thoughts were inspired by this thread, which discusses the example of adding a list of numbers. For the sake of the thought experiment, we imagine humans can't add more than two numbers, but want the AI system to correctly add arbitrarily many numbers. The most straightforward strategy for the human judge is to decide the debate honestly: rule in favor of the side which seems most likely to be true (or, in the case of Evan's mark",2020-07-15,2022-01-30 4:56:48,2022-01-30 4:56:48,2020-08-28 17:43:06,,,,,,,How should AI debate be judged?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/PR7UN9I5/how-should-ai-debate-be-judged.html,,TechSafety; MIRI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to talk about the capability of some different AI systems. You can see here that we've drawn the capability of the system we want to be  competitive with, which I’ll call the unaligned benchmark. The unaligned benchmark is what you get if you train a system on the task that will cause the system to be most generally capable. And you have no idea how it's thinking about things, and you can only point this system at some goals and not others. I think that the alignment problem looks different depending on how capable the system you’re trying to align is, and I think there are reasonable arguments for focusing on various different capabilities levels. See here for more of my thoughts on this question. ALIGNMENT STRATEGIES People have also proposed various alignment strategies. But I don’t think that these alignment strategies are competitive with the unaligned benchmark, even in theory. I want to claim that most of the action in theoretical AI alignment is people proposing various ways of getting around these problems by having your systems do things that are human understandable instead of doing things that are justified by working well. For example, the hope with imitative IDA is that through its recursive structure you can build a dataset of increasingly competent answers to questions, and then at every step you can train a system to imitate these increasingly good answers to questions, and you end up with a really powerful question-answerer that was only ever trained to imitate humans-with-access-to-aligned-systems, and so your system is outer aligned. The bar I’ve added, which represents how capable I think you can get with amplified humans, is lower than the bar for the unaligned benchmark.

And I think that different researchers often have different capability levels in mind when they talk about the alignment problem. I think this leads to confusion. I’m going to use the term “regimes of the alignment problem” to refer to the different perspectives on alignment you get from considering systems with different capability levels. (I would be pretty unsurprised if these points had all been made elsewhere; the goal of this post is just to put them all in one place. I’d love pointers to pieces that make many of the same points as this post. Thanks to a wide variety of people for conversations that informed this. If there’s established jargon for different parts of this, point it out to me and I’ll consider switching to using it.) Different regimes:  * Wildly superintelligent systems  * Systems that are roughly as generally intelligent and capable as    humans--they’re able to do all the important tasks as well as humans can, but    they’re not wildly more generally intelligent.  * Systems that are less generally intelligent and capable than humans Two main causes that lead to differences in which regime people focus on:  * Disagreements about the dynamics of AI development. Eg takeoff speeds. The    classic question along these lines is whether we have to come up with    alignment strategies that scale to arbitrarily competent systems, or whether    we just have to be able to align systems that are slightly smarter than us,    which can then do the alignment research for us.  * Disagreements about what problem we’re trying to solve. I think that there    are a few different mechanisms by which AI misalignment could be bad from a    longtermist perspective, and depending on which of these mechanisms you’re    worried about, you’ll be worried about different regimes of the problem.

It is included in the sequence because it contains a very clear explanation of some of the key ideas behind iterated amplification. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The presentation below motivates our Factored Cognition project from an AI alignment angle and describes the state of our work as of May 2018.

Before I get into the details of the project, I want to talk about the broader research program that it is part of. And to do that, I want to talk about research programs for AGI more generally. Right now, the dominant paradigm for researchers who explicitly work towards AGI is what you could call ""scalable learning and planning in complex environments"". This paradigm substantially relies on training agents in simulated physical environments to solve tasks that are similar to the sorts of tasks animals and humans can solve, sometimes in isolation and sometimes in competitive multi-agent settings. To be clear, not all tasks are physical tasks. There's also interest in more abstract environments as in the case of playing Go, proving theorems, or participating in goal-based dialog. For our purposes, the key characteristic of this research paradigm is that agents are optimized for success at particular tasks. To the extent that they learn particular decision-making strategies, those are learned implicitly. We only provide external supervision, and it wouldn't be entirely wrong to call this sort of approach ""recapitulating evolution"", even if this isn't exactly wha",2018,2022-01-30 5:00:28,2022-01-30 5:00:28,2020-12-11 23:05:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s2]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/2EC8CNMA/factored-cognition.html,,TechSafety; Ought,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here is my attempt. For the purposes of the following discussion I’m going to distinguish between (a) continuous vs. discontinuous progress in AI research, where discontinuity refers specifically to a sharp jump or change in the AI research progress curve relative to the previous curve; (b) slow vs. fast rate of progress, referring to the steepness of the progress curve slope, regardless of whether or not it’s discontinuous; and (c) long vs. short clock time – i.e., whether progress takes a long or short time relative to absolute time and not relative to previous trend lines. What exactly counts as discontinuous / fast / short will depend on what purpose we are using them for, as below. There seem to be three or four primary AI-risk-related issues that depend on whether or not there will be a discontinuity / fast takeoff speed:  1. Will we see AGI (or CAIS or TAI or whatever you want to call it) coming far     enough ahead of time such that we will be able to respond appropriately at     that point? This question in turn breaks down into two sub-questions: (a)     Will we see AGI coming before it arrives? (I.e., will there be a “fire alarm     for AGI” as Eliezer calls it.) (b) If we do see it coming, will we have     enough time to react before it’s too late?  2. Will the feedback loops during the development of AGI be long enough that we     will be able to correct course as we go?  3. Is it likely that one company / government / other entity could gain enough     first-mover advantage such that it will not be controllable or stoppable by     other entities? Let’s deal with each of these individually:  * Question 1/a: Will we see AGI coming before it arrives?

By doing so, I argued that we should instead appeal to the more general concept of  malign generalization, and treat mesa-misalignment as a special case.  Unfortunately, the post was light on examples of what we should be worrying about instead of mesa-misalignment. Evan Hubinger wrote, Personally, I think there is a meaningful sense in which all the models I'm most worried about do some sort of search internally (at least to the same extent that humans do search internally), but I'm definitely uncertain about that.Wei Dai expressed confusion why I would want to retreat to malign generalization without some sort of concrete failure mode in mind, Can you give some realistic examples/scenarios of “malign generalization” that does not involve mesa optimization? I’m not sure what kind of thing you’re actually worried about here.In this post, I will outline a general category of agents which may exhibit malign generalization without internal search, and then will provide a concrete example of an agent in the category. Then I will argue that, rather than being a very narrow counterexample, this class of agents could be competitive with search-based agents.  THE SWITCH CASE AGENT Consider an agent governed by the following general behavior,  LOOP:State = GetStateOfWorld(Observation)IF State == 1:PerformActionSequence1() IF State == 2:PerformActionSequence2()...END_LOOP  It's clear that this agent does not perform any internal search for strategies: it doesn't operate by choosing actions which rank highly according to some sort of internal objective function. While you could potentially rationalize its behavior according to some observed-utility function, this would generally lead to more confusion than clarity. However, this agent could still be malign in the following way.

Common scenarios assume misaligned goals, be it from a single AGI (paperclip maximizer) or multiple advanced AI optimizing things we don’t want (Paul Christiano’s What Failure Looks Like). Approaches around this issue ask for learning the right goals (value/preference learning), allowing the correction of a goal on the fly (corrigibility), or even removing incentives for forming goals (CAIS). But what are goals, and what does it mean to pursue one? As far as we know, Rohin Shah’s series of four posts were the first public and widely-read work questioning goals and their inevitability in AI Alignment. These posts investigate the hypothesis that goals are necessary, and outline possible alternatives. Shah calls the property of following a goal “goal-directedness”; but he doesn’t define it: I think of this as a concern about long-term goal-directed behavior. Unfortunately, it’s not clear how to categorize behavior as goal-directed vs. not. Intuitively, any agent that searches over actions and chooses the one that best achieves some measure of “goodness” is goal-directed (though there are exceptions, such as the agent that selects actions that begin with the letter “A”). (ETA: I also think that agents that show goal-directed behavior because they are looking at some other agent are not goal-directed themselves -- see this comment.) However, this is not a necessary condition: many humans are goal-directed, but there is no goal baked into the brain that they are using to choose actions. Later on, he explains that his “definition” of goal-directedness relies more on intuitions: Not all behavior can be thought of as goal-directed (primarily because I allowed the category to be defined by fuzzy intuitions rather than something more formal) Clearly, fuzzy intuitions are not enough to decide whether or not to focus on less goal-directed alternatives, if o",2021-01-18,2022-01-30 4:59:59,2022-01-30 4:59:59,2021-11-13 21:58:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,,,TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
N5K8PMXZ,blogPost,2020,"Shimi, Adam",Locality of goals,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HkWB5KCJQ2aLsMzjt/locality-of-goals,"INTRODUCTION Studying goal-directedness produces two kinds of questions: questions about goals, and questions about being directed towards a goal. Most of my previous posts focused on the second kind; this one shifts to the first kind. Assume some goal-directed system with a known goal. The nature of this goal will influence which issues of safety the system might have. If the goal focuses on the input, the system might wirehead itself and/or game its specification. On the other hand, if the goal lies firmly in the environment, the system might have convergent instrumental subgoals and/or destroy any unspecified value. Locality aims at capturing this distinction. Intuitively, the locality of the system's goal captures how far away from the system one must look to check the accomplishment of the goal.  Let's give some examples:  * The goal of ""My sensor reaches the number 23"" is very local, probably    maximally local.  * The goal of ""Maintain the temperature of the room at 23 °C"" is less local,    but still focused on a close neighborhood of the system.  * The goal of ""No death from cancer in the whole world"" is even less local. Locality isn't about how the system extract a model of the world from its input, but about whether and how much it cares about the world beyond it. STARTING POINTS This intuition about locality came from the collision of two different classification of goals: the first from from Daniel Dennett and the second from Evan Hubinger. THERMOSTATS AND GOALS In ""The Intentional Stance"", Dennett explains, extends and defends... the  intentional stance. One point he discusses is his liberalism: he is completely comfortable with admitting ridiculously simple systems like thermostats in the club of intentional systems -- to give them meaningful mental states about beliefs, desires and goals. Lest we readers feel insulted at the comparison, Dennett nonetheless admits that the goals of a thermostat differ from ours.

Rohin's note: So far, we’ve seen that ambitious value learning needs to understand human biases, and that we can't simply learn the biases in tandem with the reward. Perhaps we could hardcode a specific model of human biases? Such a model is likely to be incomplete and inaccurate, but it will perform better than assuming an optimal human, and as we notice failure modes we can improve the model. In the language of this post by Jacob Steinhardt (original  here), we are using a mis-specified human model. The post talks about why model mis-specification is worse than it may seem at first glance. This post is fairly technical and may not be accessible if you don’t have a background in machine learning. If so, you can skip this post and still understand the rest of the posts in the sequence. However, if you want to do ML-related safety research, I strongly recommend putting in the effort to understand the problems that can arise with mis-specification. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Machine learning is very good at optimizing predictions to match an observed signal — for instance, given a dataset of input images and labels of the images (e.g. dog, cat, etc.), machine learning is very good at correctly predicting the label of a new image. However, performance can quickly break down as soon as we care about criteria other than predicting observables. There are several cases where we might care about such criteria:  * In scientific investigations, we often care less about predicting a specific    observable phenomenon, and more about what that phenomenon implies about an    underlying scientific theory.  * In economic analysis, we are most interested in what policies will lead to    desirable outcomes. This requires predicting what would counterfactually    happen if we were to enact the policy, which we (usually) don’t have any data    about.  * In ma",2018,2022-01-30 4:59:59,2022-01-30 4:59:59,2020-12-17 4:36:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/KIQANXSR/gnvrixhDfG7S2TpNL.html,,TechSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's meant for anyone who found the sequence too long/challenging/technical to read.) Note that bold and italics means ""this is a new term I'm introducing,"" whereas  underline and italics is used for emphasis. WHAT IS INNER ALIGNMENT? Let's start with an abridged guide to how Machine Learning works:  1. Choose a problem  2. Decide on a space of possible solutions  3. Find a good solution from that space If the problem is ""find a tool that can look at any image and decide whether or not it contains a cat,"" then each conceivable set of rules for answering this question (formally, each function from the set of all pixels to the set {yes, no }) defines one solution. We call each such solution a model. The space of possible models is depicted below. Since that's all possible models, most of them are utter nonsense. Pick a random one, and you're as likely to end up with a car-recognizer than a cat-recognizer – but far more likely with an algorithm that does nothing we can interpret. Note that even the examples I annotated aren't typical – most models would be more complex while still doing nothing related to cats. Nonetheless, somewhere in there is a model that would do a decent job on our problem. In the above, that's the one that says, ""I look for cats."" How does ML find such a model? One way that does not work is trying out all of them. That's because the space is too large: it might contain over 101000000  candidates. Instead, there's this thing called Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) . Here's how it works: SGD begins with some (probably terrible) model and then proceeds in steps. In each step, it switches to another model that is ""close"" and hopefully a little better. Eventually, it stops and outputs the mo",2020-08-01,2022-01-30 4:59:58,2022-01-30 4:59:58,2020-08-27 16:39:11,,,,,,,Inner Alignment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/RVSBTVB2/inner-alignment-explain-like-i-m-12-edition.html,,TechSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY In this post, we summarize why we think information security (preventing unauthorized users, such as hackers, from accessing or altering information) may be an impactful career path for some people who are focused on reducing global catastrophic risks (GCRs). If you'd like to hear about job opportunities in information security and global catastrophic risk, you can fill out this form created by 80,000 Hours, and their staff will get in touch with you if something might be a good fit. In brief, we think:  * Information security (infosec) expertise may be crucial for addressing    catastrophic risks related to AI and biosecurity.  * More generally, security expertise may be useful for those attempting to    reduce GCRs, because such work sometimes involves engaging with information    that could do harm if misused.  * We have thus far found it difficult to hire security professionals who aren't    motivated by GCR reduction to work with us and some of our GCR-focused    grantees, due to the high demand for security experts and the unconventional    nature of our situation and that of some of our grantees.  * More broadly, we expect there to continue to be a deficit of GCR-focused    security expertise in AI and biosecurity, and that this deficit will result    in several GCR-specific challenges and concerns being under-addressed by    default.  * It’s more likely than not that within 10 years, there will be dozens of    GCR-focused roles in information security, and some organizations are already    looking for candidates that fit their needs (and would hire them now, if they",2019,2022-01-30 4:59:58,2022-01-30 4:59:58,2020-12-15 0:11:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/HRWPS3BN/information-security-careers-for-gcr-reduction.html,,MetaSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a first pass, it might appear that inner alignment is a sub-component of AI alignment that doesn't require making these assumptions. This is because if we define the problem of inner alignment to be the problem of how to train an AI to be aligned with arbitrary reward functions, then a solution would presumably have no dependence on any particular reward function. We could imagine an alien civilization solving the same problem, despite using very different reward functions to train their AIs. Unfortunately, the above argument fails because aligning an AI with our values requires giving the AI extra information that is not encoded directly in the reward function (under reasonable assumptions). The argument for my thesis is subtle, and so I will break it into pieces. First, I will more fully elaborate what I mean by inner alignment. Then I will argue that the definition implies that we can't come up with a full solution without some dependence on human values. Finally, I will provide an example, in order to make this discussion less abstract. CHARACTERIZING INNER ALIGNMENT In the last few posts I wrote (1, 2), I attempted to frame the problem of inner alignment in a way that wasn't too theory-laden. My concern was that the  previous characterization was dependent on a solving particular outcome where you have an AI that is using an explicit outer loop to evaluate strategies based on an explicit internal search. In the absence of an explicit internal objective function, it is difficult to formally define whether an agent is ""aligned"" with the reward function that is used to train it. We might therefore define alignment as the ability of our agent to perform well on the test distribution. However, if the test set is sampled from the same distribution as the training data, this definition is equivalent to the performance of a model in standard machine learning, and we haven't actual",2020-01-20,2022-01-30 4:59:58,2022-01-30 4:59:58,2020-09-07 18:20:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/CCM6VTKA/inner-alignment-requires-making-assumptions-about-human.html,,TechSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As I've written about before, Paul later clarified this, so my new understanding is that after the first stage, the distilled agent will be super-human in some respects and infra-human in others, but wouldn't be ""basically human"" in any sense. But IDA is aiming to eventually be super-human in almost every way (because it's aiming to be competitive with unaligned AGI), so that raises some new questions:  1. If IDA isn't going to be human-level after the first stage, then at what     stage does IDA become at-least-human-level in almost every way?  2. What exactly is the limitation that prevents the first stage of IDA from     being human-level in almost every way?  3. When IDA eventually does become at-least-human-level in almost every way,     how is the limitation from (2) avoided? That brings me to Evans et al., which contains a description of IDA in section 0. The way IDA is set up in this paper leads me to believe that the answer to (2) above is that the human overseer cannot provide a sufficient number of demonstrations for the most difficult tasks. For example, maybe the human can provide enough demonstrations for the agent to learn to answer very simple questions (tasks in T0 in the paper) but it's too time-consuming for the human to answer enough complicated questions (say, in T100). My understanding is that IDA gets around this by having an amplified system that is itself automated (i.e. does not involve humans in a major way, so cannot be bottlenecked on the slowness of humans); this allows the amplified system to provide a sufficient number of demonstrations for the distillation step to work. So in the above view, the answer to (2) is that the limitation is the number of demonstrations the human can provide, and the answer to (3) is that the human can seed the IDA process with sufficient",2020-05-02,2022-01-30 4:59:57,2022-01-30 4:59:57,2020-09-01 20:44:26,,,,,,,How does iterated amplification exceed human abilities?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/GNVB3F6I/how-does-iterated-amplification-exceed-human-abilities.html,,TechSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the conclusions don't necessarily reflect Open Phil's institutional view. ABSTRACT This post investigates the biological anchor framework for thinking about AI timelines, as espoused by Ajeya Cotra in her draft report. The basic claim of this framework is that we should base our estimates of the compute required to run a transformative model on our estimates of the compute used by the human brain (although, of course, defining what this means is complicated). This line of argument also implies that current machine learning models, some of which use amounts of compute comparable to that of bee brains, should have similar task performance as bees. In this post, I compare the performance and compute usage of both bees and machine learning models at few-shot image classification tasks. I conclude that the evidence broadly supports the biological anchor framework, and I update slightly towards the hypothesis that the compute usage of a transformative model is lower than that of the human brain. The full post is viewable in a Google Drive folder here. INTRODUCTION Ajeya Cotra wrote a draft report on AI timelines (Cotra, 2020) in which she estimates when transformative artificial intelligence might be developed. To do so, she compares the size of a transformative model (defined as the number of  FLOP/s required to run it) with the computational power of the human brain, as estimated in this Open Phil report (Carlsmith, 2020)[1]. She argues that a transformative model would use roughly similar amounts of compute as the human brain. As evidence for this, she claims that computer vision models are about as capable as bees in visual tasks, while using a similar amount of compute.[2] In this post, I (Guilhermo Costa) investigate this claim. To do so, I focus on the performance of bees at few-shot image classification, one of the most difficult tasks that bees are able to perform.

MUJIQIGS,blogPost,2020,"Campolo, Michele",Goals and short descriptions,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/d4NgfKY3cq9yiBLSM/goals-and-short-descriptions,"OUTLINE I develop some contents—previously introduced in the Value Learning sequence by Rohin Shah—more formally, to clarify the distinction between agents with and without a goal. Then I present related work and make some considerations on the relation between safety and goal-directedness. The appendix contains some details on the used formalism and can be skipped without losing much information.  A BRIEF PRELIMINARY In the first post of the Value Learning sequence, Shah compares two agents that exhibit the same behaviour (a winning strategy) when playing Tic-Tac-Toe, but are different in their design: one applies the minimax algorithm to the setting and rules of the game, while the other one follows a lookup table—you can think of its code as a long sequence of if-else statements. Shah highlights the difference in terms of generalisation: the first one would still win if the winning conditions were changed, while the lookup table would not. Generalisation is one of the components of goal-directedness, and lookup tables are among the least goal-directed agent designs. Here I want to point at another difference that exists between agents with and without a goal, based on the concept of algorithmic complexity. SETUP Most problems in AI consist in finding a function π∈AO, called policy in some contexts, where A={a1,…,am} and O={o1,…,on} indicate the sets of possible actions and observations. A deterministic policy can be written as a string π=ai 1ai2…ain with aik indicating the action taken when ok is observed. Here I consider a problem setting as a triplet (A,O,D) where D stands for some kind of environmental data—could be about, for example, the transition function in a MDP, or the structure of the elements in the search space O. Since I want to analyse behaviour across different environments, instead of considering one single policy I’ll sometimes refer to a more general function g (probably closer to the concept of “agent design”, rather than just “agent”) ma",2020-07-02,2022-01-30 4:59:56,2022-01-30 4:59:56,2020-08-31 17:44:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/KCK9EF55/goals-and-short-descriptions.html,,TechSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was paid for by Open Philanthropy but is not representative of their views. A draft was sent to Robin Hanson for review but received no response. SUMMARY  * Robin Hanson estimates the time until human-level AI by surveying experts    about the percentage progress to human-level that has happened in their    particular subfield in the last 20 years, and dividing the number of years by    the percentage progress.  * Such surveys look back on a period of extremely rapid growth of compute from    both hardware improvements and more recently skyrocketing spending.  * Hanson favors using estimates from subsets of researchers with lower progress    estimates to infer AI timelines requiring centuries worth of recent growth,    implying truly extraordinary sustained compute growth is necessary to surpass    human performance.  * Extrapolated compute levels are very large to astronomically large compared    to the neural computation that took place in evolution on Earth, and thus    likely far overestimate AI requirements and timelines. INTRODUCTION Suppose that you start with $1 that grows at 10% per year. At this rate, it will take ~241 years to get $10 billion ($1010). When will you think that you’re ten percent of the way there? You might say that you’re ten percent of the way to $10 billion when you have $1  billion. However, since your money is growing exponentially, it takes 217 years to go from $1 to $1 billion and only 24 more to go from $1 billion to $10  billion, even though the latter gap is larger in absolute terms. If you tried to guess when you would have $10 billion by taking 10x the amount of time to $1  billion, you would guess 2174 years, off by a factor of nine. Instead, you might say you’re ten percent of the way to $1010 when you have $101 , equally spacing the percentile markers along the exponent and measuring progress in terms of log(wealth).

I don’t expect many LessWrongers will read the original book in full, but I do expect that some additional clarity on what exactly Dennett was claiming about the nature of agency and goals will be helpful in having less confused intuitions and discussions about the subject. In what follows, I provide an in-depth summary of Dennett’s exposition of the intentional stance, from Chapter 2 of The Intentional Stance (“True Believers: The Intentional Strategy and Why It Works”), which Dennett considers “the flagship expression” of his position. Then, I discuss a few takeaways for thinking about agency in the context of AI safety. In brief, I think 1) we should stop talking about whether the systems we build will or won’t “be agents,” and instead debate how much it will make sense to consider a given system as “an agent,” from the information available to us, and 2) we should recognize that even our internally-experienced beliefs and desires are the result of parts of our minds “applying the intentional stance” to other parts of the mind or the mind as a whole.

Q8V6UFFR,blogPost,2020,"Shimi, Adam",Focus: you are allowed to be bad at accomplishing your goals,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/X5WTgfX5Ly4ZNHWZD/focus-you-are-allowed-to-be-bad-at-accomplishing-your-goals,"When asked about what it means for a system to be goal-directed, one common answer draws on some version of Dennett’s intentional stance: a goal-directed system is a system such that modeling it as having a goal provides accurate and efficient predictions about its behavior. I agree up to that point. But then, some people follow up by saying that the prediction is that the system will accomplish its goal. For example, it makes sense to model AlphaGo as goal-directed towards winning at Go, because it will eventually win. And taking the intentional stance allows me to predict that. But what if I make AlphaGo play against AlphaZero, which is strictly better at Go? Then AlphaGo will consistently lose. Does it mean that it’s no longer goal-directed towards winning? What feels wrong to me is the implicit link drawn between goal-directedness and competence. A bad Go player will usually lose, but it doesn’t seem any less goal-directed to me than a stronger one that consistently wins. Competence is thus not the whole story. It might be useful to compute goal-directedness; reaching some lower-bound of competency might even be a necessary condition for goal-directedness (play badly enough and it becomes debatable whether you're even trying to win). But when forcing together the two, I feel like something important is lost. To solve this problem, I propose a new metric of goal-directedness, focus: how much is the system trying to accomplish a certain goal. Focus is not the whole story about being goal-directed, but I think computing the focus of a system for some goal (details in the next paragraph) gives useful information about its goal-directedness. Given a system S (as a function from states or histories to actions) and a goal  G (as a set of states), here are the steps to compute the focus of S towards G.  * I define a reward function over states R valued 1 at states in and 0 at all    other states.  * Then I define Pol be the set of all policies that can be generate",2020-06-03,2022-01-30 4:59:48,2022-01-30 4:59:48,2020-08-31 18:22:18,,,,,,,Focus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/TSKZS9E8/focus-you-are-allowed-to-be-bad-at-accomplishing-your-goals.html,,TechSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By sheer luck you have some time, so you actually read it. And then you ask yourself the eternal question: how does this fit with the rest of the field? If you’re like me, your best guess comes from looking at the author and some keywords: this usually links the post with one of the various “schools” of AI Alignment. These tend to be affiliated with a specific researcher or lab -- there’s Paul Christiano’s kind of research, MIRI’s embedded agency, and various other approaches and agendas. Yet this is a pretty weak understanding of the place of new research. In other fields, for example Complexity Theory, you don’t really need to know who wrote the paper. It usually shows a result from one of a few types (lower bound, completeness for a class, algorithm,...), and your basic training in the field armed you with mental tools to interpret results of this type. You know the big picture of the field (defining and separating complexity classes), and how types of results are linked with it. Chances are that the authors themselves called on these mental tools to justify the value of their research. In the words of Thomas S. Kuhn, Complexity Theory is paradigmatic and AI Alignment isn’t. Paradigms, popularized in Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, capture shared assumptions on theories, interesting problems, and evaluation of solutions. They are tremendously useful to foster normal science, the puzzle-solving activity of scientists; the paradigm carves out the puzzles. Being paradigmatic also makes it easier to distinguish what’s considered valuable for the field and what isn’t, as well as how it all fits together. This list of benefit logically pushed multiple people to argue that we should make AI Alignment paradigmatic. I disagree. Or to be more accurate, I agree that we should have paradigms in the field, but I think that they should be part of a bigger epistemological struct",2021-03-08,2022-01-30 4:59:47,2022-01-30 4:59:47,2021-11-14 16:14:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/NB5NBP7R/epistemological-framing-for-ai-alignment-research.html,,MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5ICE4CS7,blogPost,2021,"Shimi, Adam",Epistemology of HCH,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/CDSXoC54CjbXQNLGr/epistemology-of-hch,"INTRODUCTION HCH is a recursive acronym meaning “Humans consulting HCH”. Coincidentally, It’s also a concept coined by Paul Christiano, central in much of the reasoning around Prosaic AI Alignment. Yet for many, me included, the various ways in which it is used are sometimes confusing. I believe that the tools of Epistemology and Philosophy of Science can help understand it better, and push further the research around it. So this post doesn’t give yet another explanation of HCH; instead, it asks about the different perspectives we can take on it. These perspectives capture the form of knowledge that HCH is, what it tells us about AI Alignment, and how to expand, judge and interpret this knowledge. I then apply these perspectives to examples of research on HCH, to show the usefulness of the different frames. Thanks to Joe Collman, Jérémy Perret, Richard Ngo, Evan Hubinger and Paul Christiano for feedback on this post. IS IT A SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION? IS IT A MODEL OF COMPUTATION? NO, IT’S HCH! HCH was originally defined in Humans Consulting HCH: Consider a human Hugh who has access to a question-answering machine. Suppose the machine answers question Q by perfectly imitating how Hugh would answer question Q, if Hugh had access to the question-answering machine. That is, Hugh is able to consult a copy of Hugh, who is able to consult a copy of Hugh, who is able to consult a copy of Hugh… Let’s call this process HCH, for “Humans Consulting HCH.” Nowadays, this is actually called weak HCH, after the Strong HCH post which extended the definition. That being said, I’m only interested in perspective about HCH, which includes the questions asked about it and how to answer them. Although the difference between Weak and Strong HCH matters for the answers, the questions and perspective stay the same. I’ll thus use HCH to mean one or the other interchangeably. The main use of HCH is as an ideal for what a question-answerer aligned with a given human should be like.

UG62BDKC,blogPost,2021,"Ngo, Richard",Eight claims about multi-agent AGI safety,,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dSAJdi99XmqftqXXq/eight-claims-about-multi-agent-agi-safety,"There are quite a few arguments about how interactions between multiple AGIs affect risks from AGI development. I’ve identified at least eight distinct but closely-related claims which it seems worthwhile to disambiguate. I’ve split them up into four claims about the process of training AGIs, and four claims about the process of deploying AGIs; after listing them, I go on to explain each in more detail. Note that while I believe that all of these ideas are interesting enough to warrant further investigation, I don’t currently believe that all of them are true as stated. In particular, I think that so far there's been little compelling explanation of why interactions between many aligned AIs might have castastrophic effects on the world (as is discussed in point 7). CLAIMS ABOUT TRAINING 1. Multi-agent training is one of the most likely ways we might build AGI. 2. Multi-agent training is one of the most dangerous ways we might build AGI. 3. Multi-agent training is a regime in which standard safety techniques won’t work. 4. Multi-agent training allows us to implement important new safety techniques. CLAIMS ABOUT DEPLOYMENT 5. We should expect the first AGIs to be deployed in a world which already contains many nearly-as-good AIs. 6. We should expect AGIs to be deployed as multi-agent collectives. 7. Lack of coordination between multiple deployed AGIs is a major source of existential risk. 8. Conflict between multiple deployed AGIs risks causing large-scale suffering. DETAILS AND ARGUMENTS 1. Multi-agent training is one of the most likely ways we might build AGI. The core argument for this thesis is that multi-agent interaction was a key feature of the evolution of human intelligence, by promoting both competition and cooperation. Competition between humans provides a series of challenges which are always at roughly the right level of difficulty; Liebo et al. (2019)  call this an autocurriculum. Autocurricula were crucial for training sophisticated reinforcem",2021,2022-01-30 4:59:47,2022-01-30 4:59:47,2021-11-13 19:29:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/MEED299E/eight-claims-about-multi-agent-agi-safety.html,,MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RW8QKTQX,blogPost,2020,"Barnett, Matthew",Distinguishing definitions of takeoff,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/YgNYA6pj2hPSDQiTE/distinguishing-definitions-of-takeoff,"I find discussions about AI takeoff to be very confusing. Often, people will argue for ""slow takeoff"" or ""fast takeoff"" and then when I ask them to operationalize what those terms mean, they end up saying something quite different than what I thought those terms meant.  To help alleviate this problem, I aim to compile the definitions of AI takeoff that I'm currently aware of, with an emphasis on definitions that have clear specifications. I will continue updating the post as long as I think it serves as a useful reference for others. In this post, an AI takeoff can be roughly construed as ""the dynamics of the world associated with the development of powerful artificial intelligence."" These definitions characterize different ways that the world can evolve as  transformative AI is developed.  FOOM/HARD TAKEOFF The traditional hard takeoff position, or ""Foom"" position (these appear to be equivalent terms) was characterized in this post from Eliezer Yudkowsky. It contrasts Hanson's takeoff scenario by emphasizing local dynamics: rather than a population of artificial intelligences coming into existence, there would be a single intelligence that quickly reaches a level of competence that outstrips the world's capabilities to control it. The proposed mechanism that causes such a dynamic is recursive self improvement, though Yudkowsky later suggested that this wasn't necessary. The ability for recursive self improvement to induce a hard takeoff was defended in Intelligence Explosion Microeconomics. He argues against Robin Hanson in the  AI Foom debates. Watch this video to see the live debate. Given the word ""hard"" in this notion of takeoff, a ""soft"" takeoff could simply be defined as the negation of a hard takeoff. HANSONIAN ""SLOW"" TAKEOFF Robin Hanson objected to hard takeoff by predicting that growth in AI capabilities will not be extremely uneven between projects. In other words, there is unlikely to be one AI project, or even a small set of AI projects, that pro",2020-02-13,2022-01-30 4:59:46,2022-01-30 4:59:46,2020-09-05 18:49:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/X6ZTTITS/distinguishing-definitions-of-takeoff.html,,MetaSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One important way to do this is to distinguish between claims about training processes which produce AGIs, versus claims about AGIs themselves, which I’ll call deployment  claims. I think many foundational concepts in AI safety are clarified by this distinction. In this post I outline some of them, and state new versions of the orthogonality and instrumental convergence theses which take this distinction into account. GOAL SPECIFICATION The most important effect of thinking in terms of machine learning concepts is clarity about what it might mean to specify a goal. Early characterisations of how we might specify the goals of AGIs focused on agents which choose between actions on the basis of an objective function hand-coded by humans. Deep Blue is probably the most well-known example of this; AIXI can also be interpreted as doing so. But this isn't how modern machine learning systems work. So my current default picture of how we will specify goals for AGIs is:  * At training time, we identify a method for calculating the feedback to give    to the agent, which will consist of a mix of human evaluations and automated    evaluations. I’ll call this the objective function. I expect that we will use    an objective function which rewards the agent for following commands given to    it by humans in natural language.  * At deployment time, we give the trained agent commands in natural language.    The objective function is no longer used; hopefully the agent instead has    internalised a motivation/goal to act in ways which humans would approve of,    which leads it to follow our commands sensibly and safely. This breakdown makes the inner alignment problem a very natural concept - it’s simply the case where the agent’s learned motivations don’t corres",2021-02-03,2022-01-30 4:59:46,2022-01-30 4:59:46,2021-11-13 22:42:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/M5B7NFQM/distinguishing-claims-about-training-vs-deployment.html,,MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
XGEAUCIT,blogPost,2020,"Casper, Stephen",Dissolving Confusion around Functional Decision Theory,LessWrong,,,,https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xoQRz8tBvsznMXTkt/dissolving-confusion-around-functional-decision-theory,"SUMMARY Functional Decision Theory (FDT), (see also causal, evidential, timeless,  updateless, and anthropic decision theories) recommends taking cooperative, non-greedy actions in twin prisoners dilemmas, Newcombian problems, Parfit’s hitchhiker-like games, and counterfactual muggings but not smoking lesion situations. It’s a controversial concept with important implications for designing agents that have optimal behavior when embedded in environments in which they may potentially interact with models of themselves. Unfortunately, I think that FDT is sometimes explained confusingly and misunderstood by its proponents and opponents alike. To help dissolve confusion about FDT and address key concerns of its opponents, I refute the criticism that FDT assumes that causation can happen backward in time and offer two key principles that provide a framework for clearly understanding it:  1. Questions in decision theory are not questions about what choices you should     make with some sort of unpredictable free will. They are questions about     what type of source code you should be running.   2. I should consider predictor P to “subjunctively depend” on agent A to the     extent that P makes predictions of A’s actions based on correlations that     cannot be confounded by my choice of what source code A runs.  GETTING UP TO SPEED I think that functional decision theory (FDT) is a beautifully counterintuitive and insightful framework for instrumental rationally. I will not make it my focus here to talk about what it is and what types of situations it is useful in. To gain a solid background, I recommend this post of mine or the original paper on it by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares.  Additionally, here are four different ways that FDT can be explained. I find them all complimentary for understanding and intuiting it well.  1.

Crucially, this excludes using the author's code. This is important, as a paper should distill insights rather than just report results. If minor technical details in a reimplementation can lead to vastly different results, this suggests that the paper did not accurately capture all important aspects. The distinction between reproducibility and independent reproducibility is similar to the previously suggested distinctions between <@reproducibility of methods and reproducibility of conclusions@>(@Unreproducible Research is Reproducible@) and [replicability and reproducibility](http://cogprints.org/7691/7/ICMLws09.pdf).

The author attempted to replicate 255 machine learning papers, of which 162 were successfully replicated and ran a statistical analysis on the results. Factors that helped with independent reproduction included specified hyperparameters, ease of reading and authors answering emails. Meanwhile, neither shared code nor the inclusion of pseudo-code robustly increased the rate of reproduction. Interestingly, papers with a strong focus on theory performed worse than mostly empirical or mixed ones. While more rigour can certainly be valuable in the long term, including learning bounds or complicated math, just for the sake of it should thus be avoided.

Of course, such a system must be made extremely reliable, since a failure could result in Google's data centers going down. They implemented several safety measures. They throw out any actions that the AI is not confident about. All actions are verified against a set of hand-coded safety rules, both when the actions are generated in the cloud, and at each local data center, for reliability through redundancy. There are human operators monitoring the AI to make sure nothing goes wrong, who can take over control whenever they want to. There is also an automated system that will fall back to the original system of heuristics and rules if the safety conditions are ever violated."

Part of the difficulty with discussing the value of HRAD work is that it's not even clear what the disagreement is about, so my summary takes the form of multiple possible ""worlds"" we might be in; each world consists of a positive case for doing HRAD work, along with the potential objections to that case, which results in one or more cruxes. I will talk about ""being in a world"" throughout this post. What I mean by this is the following: If we are ""in world X"", that means that the case for HRAD work outlined in world X is the one that most resonates with MIRI people as their motivation for doing HRAD work; and that when people disagree about the value of HRAD work, this is what the disagreement is about. When I say that ""I think we are in this world"", I don't mean that I agree with this case for HRAD work; it just means that this is what I think MIRI people think. In this post, the pro-HRAD stance is something like ""HRAD work is the most important kind of technical research in AI alignment; it is the overwhelming priority and we're pretty much screwed if we under-invest in this kind of research"" and the anti-HRAD stance is something like ""HRAD work seems significantly less promising than other technical AI alignment agendas, such as the approaches to directly align machine learning systems (e.g. iterated amplification)"". There is a much weaker pro-HRAD stance, which is something like ""HRAD work is interesting and doing more of it adds value, but it's not necessarily the most important kind of technical AI alignment research to be working on""; this post is not about this weaker stance.

HRAD is a category of work at MIRI that aims to build a theory of intelligence and agency that can explain things like logical uncertainty and counterfactual reasoning.

The first case for HRAD work is that by becoming less confused about these phenomena, we will be able to help AGI builders predict, explain, avoid, detect, and fix safety issues and help to conceptually clarify the AI alignment problem. For this purpose, we just need _conceptual_ deconfusion -- it isn’t necessary that there must be precise equations defining what an AI system does.

The second case is that if we get a precise, mathematical theory, we can use it to build an agent that we understand “from the ground up”, rather than throwing the black box of deep learning at the problem.

The last case is that understanding how intelligence works will give us a theory that allows us to predict how _arbitrary_ agents will behave, which will be useful for AI alignment in all the ways described in the first case and <@more@>(@Theory of Ideal Agents, or of Existing Agents?@).

Looking through past discussions on the topic, the author believes that people at MIRI primarily believe in the first two cases. Meanwhile, critics (particularly me) say that it seems pretty unlikely that we can build a precise, mathematical theory, and a more conceptual but imprecise theory may help us understand reasoning better but is less likely to generalize sufficiently well to say important and non-trivial things about AI alignment for the systems we are actually building."
CMIVXP8V,blogPost,2020,Sublation,Openness Norms in AGI Development,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/RvrTZ3qKWpg9aiFqZ/openness-norms-in-agi-development,"1. INTRODUCTION This post outlines two models from the social epistemology of science explaining the emergence of the a particular openness norm within the sciences, and then looks at how such models can be utilised to understand research groups trying to develop AGI. In the rest of the introduction, I will try to provide some motivation for this post. Sections 2 & 3 will briefly outline the two models I'm looking at. Section 4 more directly tries to interpret such models in the context of AGI development. Section 5 concludes.  The social epistemology of science is an interdisciplinary subfield at the intersection of philosophy and economics, which utilises formal models to understand the incentive structure of science. Here, I focus on two models from this area which try to explain the emergence of one particular openness norm: the so-called ‘communist norm’ in scientific research. The communist norm is a norm to share all ‘substantive findings’ with the scientific community. The existence of this norm seems to be taken for granted in this literature, although the best piece of evidence I can find for its existence comes from  Louis et. al (2001), who find, in a sample of nearly 2,000 geneticists, that 91% agree that one should share all of one's relevant data. I nevertheless take it for granted in this post. I wanted to see whether understanding the emergence of the communist norm in science could be important for understanding the development of AGI. In many ways, one might think the incentive structures around the development of AGI (will, or does) parallel the incentive structures of academic science. Thus, one might think that looking at the incentive structures behind scientific research are a good starting point for looking at the incentive structures surrounding the development of AGI.  As the communist norm emerged in science, one can imagine the emergence of a similar ‘communist norm’ across research groups involved in AGI development, where research g",2020-03-30,2020-09-05 18:05,2020-12-21 18:33,2020-09-05 18:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/angelica/Zotero/storage/M622F268/openness-norms-in-agi-development.html,,Other-org; MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This post summarizes two papers that provide models of why scientific research tends to be so open, and then applies it to the development of powerful AI systems. The [first](http://www.strevens.org/research/scistruc/Communicans.pdf) models science as a series of discoveries, in which the first academic group to reach a discovery gets all the credit for it. It shows that for a few different models of info-sharing, info-sharing helps everyone reach the discovery sooner, but doesn't change the probabilities for who makes the discovery first (called _race-clinching probabilities_): as a result, sharing all information is a better strategy than sharing none (and is easier to coordinate on than the possibly-better strategy of sharing just some information).

However, this theorem doesn't apply when info sharing compresses the discovery probabilities _unequally_ across actors: in this case, the race-clinching probabilities _do_ change, and the group whose probability would go down is instead incentivized to keep information secret (which then causes everyone else to keep their information secret). This could be good news: it suggests that actors are incentivized to share safety research (which probably doesn't affect race-clinching probabilities) while keeping capabilities research secret (thereby leading to longer timelines).

The [second paper](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/13452/1/Heesen%202017%20Communism%20and%20the%20Incentive%20to%20Share%20in%20Science%20preprint.pdf) assumes that scientists are competing to complete a k-stage project, and whenever they publish, they get credit for all the stages they completed that were not yet published by anyone else. It also assumes that earlier stages have a higher credit-to-difficulty ratio (where difficulty can be different across scientists). It finds that under this setting scientists are incentivized to publish whenever possible. For AI development, this seems not to be too relevant: we should expect that with powerful AI systems, most of the ""credit"" (profit) comes from the last few stages, where it is possible to deploy the AI system to earn money."

In the post I try to describe why. I start by describing my current model of human values, how I interpret Stuart's implicit assumptions to conflict with it, and then talk about my confusion with regard to reconciling the two views. THE TWO-LAYER/ULM MODEL OF HUMAN VALUES In Player vs. Character: A Two-Level Model of Ethics, Sarah Constantin describes a model where the mind is divided, in game terms, into a ""player"" and a ""character"". The character is everything that we consciously experience, but our conscious experiences are not our true reasons for acting. As Sarah puts it: In many games, such as Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, or Dungeons and Dragons, there’s a two-phase process. First, the player constructs adeck or character from a very large sample space of possibilities. This is a particular combination of strengths and weaknesses and capabilities for action, which the player thinks can be successful against other decks/characters or at winning in the game universe. The choice of deck or character often determines the strategies that deck or character can use in the second phase, which is actual gameplay. In gameplay, the character (or deck) can only use the affordances that it’s been previously set up with. This means that there are two separate places where a player needs to get things right: first, in designing a strong character/deck, and second, in executing the optimal strategies for that character/deck during gameplay. [...]The idea is that human behavior works very much like a two-level game. [...] The player determines what we find rewarding or unrewarding. The player determines what we notice and what we overlook; things come to our attention if it suits the player’s strategy, and not otherwise. The player gives us emotions when it’s strategic to do so.

However, in reality, it seems likely that the brain is a big learning machine without any innate ""values"", and what we experience as our conscious selves is a ""strategy"" chosen by this learning machine, and as such does not have a sensible interpretation as something that optimizes for ""values"". The author suggests that value learning agendas need to deal directly with the fact that there are these two ""layers"" in humans, and presents some preliminary thoughts that don't reach any particular conclusions."

I: Intro I am extremely sympathetic to the program of AI safety by understanding value learning. Because of that sympathy, I have more thoughts than average prompted by Stuart Armstrong's post along those same lines. Stuart's post mostly deals with ""partial preferences,"" which are like simple statements of binary preference (A is better than B), but associated with a context - supposedly the ""human's model"" the human was using when they exhibited or stated that preference. Then the post says that you should sort these partial preferences according to meta-levels and aggregate them from the top down, updating your procedure after you finish each meta-level, eventually producing a utility function over world-histories. Broadly, I'd say that my opinion is sort of like the bitter lesson. The bitter lesson in, say, image recognition, is that people wanted to do image recognition with a bunch of human-designed features and formal reasoning and human-understandable internal moving parts, and they tried that for a long time, and what worked was using way bigger models, way more computing power, much fewer human-understandable internal parts, and almost no human-designed features. I like Stuart's outline more than most value learning proposals. But it still strikes me as primarily a list of human-designed features and human-understandable internal moving parts. We might be better off throwing away some of the details and abstracting in a way that allows for some of these problems to be solved by big models and computing power. It's like the just-so story about ResNets, which is that they're a fix to humans thinking the insides of neural nets should look too much like human logic[^1]. I think speculating about the human-sized logical relationships between speculative parts inside the AI is easier but less useful than speculating about the algorithm that will connect your inputs to your outputs with a big model and lots of computing power, which may",2019,2020-12-14 23:56,2020-12-17 3:25,2020-12-14 23:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: N/A,,,,Other-org; NotSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This post makes two main critiques of the research agenda in the previous entry.

Patterns can form that exploit the imperfect nature of the search function to perpetuate themselves. johnswentworth refers to such patterns as ""demons"". After reading that post I decided to see if I could observe demon formation in a simple model: gradient descent on a not-too-complicated mathematical function. It turns out that even in this very simplistic case, demon formation can happen. Hopefully this post will give people an example of demon formation where the mechanism is simple and easy to visualize. MODEL The function we try to minimize using gradient descent is called the loss function. Here it is: L(→x)=−x0+ϵn∑j=1xj⋅splotchj(→x) Let me explain what some of the parts of this loss mean. Each function splotchj( →x) is periodic with period 2π in every component of →x. I decided in this case to make my splotch functions out of a few randomly chosen sine waves added together. ϵ is chosen to be a small number so in any local region, ϵ∑nj=1xj⋅splotchj(→x)  will look approximately periodic: A bunch of hills repeating over and over again with period 2π across the landscape.

Travel a distance of 20π in the x7 direction, and splotch7 will be a larger component of the repeating pattern than it was before. This allows for selection effects. The −x0 term means that the vector →x mainly wants to increase its x0 component. But the splotch functions can also direct its motion. A splotch function might have a kind of ridge that directs some of the x0 motion into other components.

The post runs a simple gradient descent algorithm in an artifically constructed search space. The loss function that defines the search space has two major parts. One part straightforwardly tries to get the algorithm to move as far as it can in a particular direction _x0_ -- this represents our original objective function. The other part can be thought of as a series of periodic 'valleys' along every other axis, (_x1_ ... _xn_) that get steeper the farther you go along that axis.

When running the gradient descent, at first _x0_ increases steadily, and the other coordinates wander around more or less randomly. In the second phase, a self-reinforcing combination of valleys (a ""demon"") takes hold and amplifies itself drastically, feeding off the large _x0_ gradient. Finally, this demon becomes so strong that the search gets stuck in a local valley and further progress stops."
E8FU2VV4,blogPost,2020,"Shimi, Adam",Universality Unwrapped,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/farherQcqFQXqRcvv/universality-unwrapped,"INTRODUCTION Informally, a universal system is universal with respect to any computation; and it is a universal system with respect to a given computation if it understands every set of beliefs that can be ascribed to the computation. The intuition is that the system can reverse engineer most or all of the computation, in order to monitor it or imitate it. This in turn has important consequences for questions of alignment and competitiveness. Universality is the property that defines a universal system. And it is the point of this post. Universality tries to capture a property needed for many alignement schemes. It was proposed by Paul Christiano, the mind behind many approaches and ideas in the prosaic AGI space, and a founding member of the safety team at OpenAI. Rohin Shah dedicated a full Alignment Newsletter to covering all 6 posts on Universality. Rohin and Evan Hubinger, two important researchers in this field, consider Universality as one of the most exciting research idea of the last few years.[1] Yet nobody talks about Universality. Except for the Alignment Newsletter mentioned above and a response post by Evan, nothing in the Alignment Forum addresses this idea. I've seen no great discussion, no debates, no counter-arguments or criticism. The original post on Medium has no comments, and the crossposted version here only has a handful, mostly asking for clarification. And the other posts in the sequence rely on understanding this first. The simplest solution to this problem is to tell you to read the original post. Unfortunately, it is as dense as Q in R, brimming with ideas, intuitions, semi-formal explanations and the many meanderings that research takes before arriving on solid ground. That is to say, you'll have to work for it. Not everyone who might benefit from an understanding of Universality has the time, the need or the want for such an upfront investment.

AWQS8IRG,blogPost,2020,"Martin, Sammy",Will AI undergo discontinuous progress?,AI Alignment Forum,,,,https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5WECpYABCT62TJrhY/will-ai-undergo-discontinuous-progress,"This post grew out of conversations with several people, including Daniel Kokotajlo, grue_slinky and Linda Lisefors, and is based in large part on a collection of scattered comments and blog-posts across lesswrong, along with some podcast interviews - e.g. here. The in-text links near quotes will take you to my sources. I am attempting to distinguish two possibilities which are often run together - that progress in AI towards AGI (‘takeoff’) will be discontinuous and that it will be fast, but continuous. Resolving this distinction also addresses the claim that there has been a significant shift in arguments for AI presenting an existential risk: from older arguments discussing an ultra-fast intelligence explosion occurring in a single ‘seed AI’ to more moderate scenarios. I argue that the ‘shift in arguments on AI safety’ is not a total change in basic assumptions (which some observers have claimed) but just a reduction in confidence about a specifically discontinuous takeoff. Finally, I try to explicitly operationalize the practical differences between discontinuous takeoff and fast, continuous takeoff.

If we were to graph world GDP over the last 10,000 years, it fits onto a hyperbolic growth pattern. We could call this ‘continuous’ since it is following a single trend, or we could call it ‘discontinuous’ because, on the scale of millennia, the industrial revolution exploded out of nowhere. I will call these sorts of hyperbolic trends ‘continuous, but fast’, in line with Paul Christiano, who argued for continuous takeoff, defining it this way: AI is just another, faster step in the hyperbolic g",2020-02-21,2020-09-05 18:50,2020-12-21 18:20,2020-09-05 18:50,,,,,,,Will AI undergo discontinuous progress?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: N/A,,/Users/angelica/Zotero/storage/GQ36CW4I/will-ai-undergo-discontinuous-progress.html,,Other-org; MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This post argues that the debate over takeoff speeds is over a smaller issue than you might otherwise think: people seem to be arguing for either discontinuous progress, or continuous but fast progress. Both camps agree that once AI reaches human-level intelligence, progress will be extremely rapid; the disagreement is primarily about whether there is already quite a lot of progress _before_ that point. As a result, these differences don't constitute a ""shift in arguments on AI safety"", as some have claimed.

The post also goes through some of the arguments and claims that people have made in the past, which I'm not going to summarize here."

One key insight is that increasing the width of the network layers makes it *easier* to understand. More precisely, as the width is sent to infinity the network's learning dynamics can be approximated with a Taylor expansion and become a kernel problem. This kernel has an exact form in the limit and is referred to as the neural tangent kernel (NTK). Ultimately, this allows us to model the network with a simpler model known as a Gaussian process. Unfortunately, showing this analytically is difficult and creating efficient implementations is cumbersome. **The authors address this problem by introducing ""Neural Tangents"", a library that makes creating infinite-width networks as easy as creating their finite counterparts with libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.** They include support for convolutions with full-padding, residual-connections, feed-forward networks, and support for a variety of activation functions. Additionally, there is out-of-the-box support for CPU, GPU, and TPU. Moreover, uncertainty comparisons with finite ensembles are possible via exact Bayesian inference."

If all goes well, human history is just beginning. Our species could survive for billions of years - enough time to end disease, poverty, and injustice, and to flourish in ways unimaginable today. But this vast future is at risk. With the advent of nuclear weapons, humanity entered a new age, where we face existential catastrophes - those from which we could never come back. Since then, these dangers have only multiplied, from climate change to engineered pathogens and artificial intelligence. If we do not act fast to reach a place of safety, it will soon be too late.  Drawing on over a decade of research, The Precipice explores the cutting-edge science behind the risks we face. It puts them in the context of the greater story of humanity: showing how ending these risks is among the most pressing moral issues of our time. And it points the way forward, to the actions and strategies that can safeguard humanity.  An Oxford philosopher committed to putting ideas into action, Toby Ord has advised the US National Intelligence Council, the UK Prime Minister's Office, and the World Bank on the biggest questions facing humanity.

We introduce a general definition of side effects, based on relative reachability of states compared to a default state, that avoids these undesirable incentives. Using a set of gridworld experiments illustrating relevant scenarios, we empirically compare relative reachability to penalties based on existing definitions and show that it is the only penalty among those tested that produces the desired behavior in all the scenarios.",2018-06-04,2022-01-30 4:52:39,2022-01-30 4:52:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,ZSCC: 0000014,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Viktoriya_Krakovna/publication/325557348_Measuring_and_avoiding_side_effects_using_relative_reachability/links/5bb7e5eaa6fdcc9552d46b02/Measuring-and-avoiding-side-effects-using-relative-reachability.pdf,TechSafety; DeepMind; AmbiguosSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accumulation of power might either happen gradually over time, or it might happen very rapidly (a so-called “hard takeoff”). Gradual accumulation would happen through normal economic mechanisms, as AGIs came to carry out an increasing share of economic tasks.

Much of the international law literature thus far has focused on the implications of increasingly autonomous weapons systems. Our contribution instead seeks to cover a broader range of global security risks resulting from large-scale diffuse or concentrated, gradual or sudden, direct or indirect, intentional or unintentional, AI or robotics-caused harm. Applications of these technologies permeate almost every domain of human activity and thus unsurprisingly have an equally wide range of risk profiles, from a discriminatory algorithmic decision causing financial distress to an AI-sparked nuclear war collapsing global civilization. Hence, it is only natural that much of the international regulatory activity takes place in domain-specific fora. Many of these fora coordinate with each other, both within and beyond the UN system, spreading insights and best practices on how to deal with common concerns such as cybersecurity, monitoring, and reliability, so as to prevent accidents and misuse.",2019-01-15,2022-01-30 4:50:24,2022-01-30 4:50:24,2020-08-21 20:05:39,,,,,,,,,,,,Social Science Research Network,"Rochester, NY",en,,,,,papers.ssrn.com,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s3]  ACC: 6  DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.3310421,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BVDRNTDD/papers.html,,MetaSafety; CFI; CSER; AmbiguosSafety,artificial intelligence; global security; international law; robotics,"Geiß, Robin; Melzer, Nils",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the extent that ethics is a cognitive pursuit, a superintelligence could also easily surpass humans in the quality of its moral thinking. However, it would be up to the designers of the superintelligence to specify its original motivations. Since the superintelligence may become unstoppably powerful because of its intellectual superiority and the technologies it could develop, it is crucial that it be provided with human-friendly motivations.

This points to the need for moral reflection as we approach the era of advanced machine intelligence. Here we focus on one set of issues, which arise from the prospect of digital minds with superhumanly strong claims to resources and influence. These could arise from the vast collective benefits that mass-produced digital minds could derive from relatively small amounts of resources. Alternatively, they could arise from individual digital minds with superhuman moral status or ability to benefit from resources.

When the human has a goal pose they’d like to place the object at, however, the most comfortable grasping conﬁguration at the handover might be cumbersome overall, requiring regrasping or the use of an uncomfortable conﬁguration to reach the goal. We enable robots to purposefully inﬂuence the choices available to the person when taking the object, implicitly helping the person avoid suboptimal solutions and account for the goal.

Even faceless corporations, meddling governments, reckless scientists, and other agents of doom, require a world in which to achieve their goals of profit, order, tenure, or other villainies. If our extinction proceeds slowly enough to allow a moment of horrified realization, the doers of the deed will likely be quite taken aback on realizing that they have actually destroyed the world. Therefore I suggest that if the Earth is destroyed, it will probably be by mistake. The systematic experimental study of reproducible errors of human reasoning, and what these errors reveal about underlying mental processes, is known as the heuristics and biases programme in cognitive psychology. This programme has made discoveries highly relevant to assessors of global catastrophic risks. Suppose you are worried about the risk of Substance P, an explosive of planet-wrecking potency which will detonate if exposed to a strong radio signal. Luckily there is a famous expert who discovered Substance P, spent the last thirty years working with it, and knows it better than anyone else in the world. You call up the expert and ask how strong the radio signal has to be. The expert replies that the critical threshold is probably around 4000 terawatts. ‘Probably?’ you query. ‘Can you give me a 98% confidence interval?’ ‘Sure’, replies the expert. ‘I’m 99%confident that the critical threshold is above 500 terawatts, and 99%confident that the threshold is below 80,000 terawatts.’ ‘What about 10 terawatts?’ you ask. ‘Impossible’, replies the expert. The above methodology for expert elicitation looks perfectly reasonable, the sort of thing any competent practitioner might do when faced with such a problem. Indeed, this methodology was used in the Reactor Safety Study (Rasmussen, 1975), now widely regarded as the first major attempt at probabilistic risk assessment. But the student of heuristics and biases will recognize at least two major mistakes in the method – not logical flaws, but conditions extremely susceptible to human error. I shall return to this example in the discussion of anchoring and adjustments biases (Section 5.7).",2008-07-03,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2020-11-22 5:05:28,,,,,,,,,,,,Oxford University Press,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s2]  ACC: 231  DOI: 10.1093/oso/9780198570509.003.0009,,,,MetaSafety; MIRI,,,,,,,"Yudkowsky, Eliezer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of course, this problem is not limited to the field of AI. Jacques Monod wrote: ‘A curious aspect of the theory of evolution is that everybody thinks he understands it’ (Monod, 1974). The problem seems to be unusually acute in Artificial Intelligence. The field of AI has a reputation for making huge promises and then failing to deliver on them. Most observers conclude that AI is hard, as indeed it is. But the embarrassment does not stem from the difficulty. It is difficult to build a star from hydrogen, but the field of stellar astronomy does not have a terrible reputation for promising to build stars and then failing. The critical inference is not that AI is hard, but that, for some reason, it is very easy for people to think they know far more about AI than they actually do. It may be tempting to ignore Artificial Intelligence because, of all the global risks discussed in this book, AI is probably hardest to discuss. We cannot consult actuarial statistics to assign small annual probabilities of catastrophe, as with asteroid strikes. We cannot use calculations from a precise, precisely confirmed model to rule out events or place infinitesimal upper bounds on their probability, as with proposed physics disasters. But this makes AI catastrophes more worrisome, not less. The effect of many cognitive biases has been found to increase with time pressure, cognitive busyness, or sparse information. Which is to say that the more difficult the analytic challenge, the more important it is to avoid or reduce bias. Therefore I strongly recommend reading my other chapter (Chapter 5) in this book before continuing with this chapter. When something is universal enough in our everyday lives, we take it for granted to the point of forgetting it exists. Imagine a complex biological adaptation with ten necessary parts. If each of the ten genes is independently at 50% frequency in the gene pool – each gene possessed by only half the organisms in that species – then, on average, only 1 in 1024 organisms will possess the full, functioning adaptation.",2008-07-03,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2020-11-22 2:24:05,184,,,,,,,,,,,Oxford University Press,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: 0000552  Publisher: Oxford University Press New York,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/UTV64Q5B/Yudkowsky - 2008 - Artificial intelligence as a positive and negative.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/A94A8CPN/sTkfAQAAQBAJ.html,,MetaSafety; MIRI,,,,,,,"Yudkowsky, Eliezer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other global risks have longer histories and larger bodies of scholarship. The study of these other risks can offer considerable insight to the study of AI risk. This paper examines four risks: biotechnology, nuclear weapons, global warming, and asteroid collision. Several overarching lessons are found. First, the extreme severity of global risks is often insufficient to motivate action to reduce the risks. Second, perceptions of global risks can be influenced by people’s incentives and by their cultural and intellectual orientations. Third, the success of efforts to address global risks can depend on the extent of buy-in from parties who may be negatively affected by the efforts. Fourth, global risks and risk reduction initiatives can be shaped by broader socio-political conditions, such as the degree of policy influence of private industry within a political jurisdiction. The paper shows how these and other lessons can inform efforts to reduce risks from AI.",2019,2022-01-30 4:55:19,2022-01-30 4:55:19,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s3]  ACC: 2,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/TNHAPD98/Baum - Lessons for Artificial Intelligence from Other Glo.pdf,,MetaSafety; GCRI,,"Tinnirello, Maurizio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intelligent agent is patterned closely after AIXI with these speciﬁc assumptions: 1) The agent is allowed to arbitrarily modify its own inputs if it so chooses; 2) The agent’s code is a part of the environment and may be read and written by the environment. The ﬁrst of these we call the “delusion box”; the second we call “mortality”. Within this framework, we discuss and compare four very diﬀerent kinds of agents, speciﬁcally: reinforcementlearning, goal-seeking, prediction-seeking, and knowledge-seeking agents. Our main results are that: 1) The reinforcement-learning agent under reasonable circumstances behaves exactly like an agent whose sole task is to survive (to preserve the integrity of its code); and 2) Only the knowledge-seeking agent behaves completely as expected.",2011,2022-01-30 4:59:45,2022-01-30 4:59:45,2020-11-21 17:39:39,11-20,,,6830,,,,,,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"Berlin, Heidelberg",en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: 77  Series Title: Lecture Notes in Computer Science DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-22887-2_2,,"/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/FRZ9DPD5/Ring and Orseau - 2011 - Delusion, Survival, and Intelligent Agents.pdf",,TechSafety; Other-org,,"Schmidhuber, Jürgen; Thórisson, Kristinn R.; Looks, Moshe","Hutchison, David; Kanade, Takeo; Kittler, Josef; Kleinberg, Jon M.; Mattern, Friedemann; Mitchell, John C.; Naor, Moni; Nierstrasz, Oscar; Pandu Rangan, C.; Steffen, Bernhard; Sudan, Madhu; Terzopoulos, Demetri; Tygar, Doug; Vardi, Moshe Y.; Weikum, Gerhard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A technological singularity encompasses two claims: (a) the enhancement of human cognitive capacities by the computer, and (b) their displacement from the center of the production of knowledge. For computer simulations to be a technological singularity, then, they must fulfill points (a) and (b) above. Although point (a) is relatively unproblematic, point (b) needs further analysis. In particular, in order to show that humans could be displaced from the center of the production of knowledge, it is necessary to establish the reliability of computer simulations. That is, I need to show that computer simulations are reliable processes that render, most of the time, valid results. To be a reliable process, in turn, means that simulations accurately represent the target system and carry out error-free computations. I analyze verification and validation methods as the grounds for such representation accuracy and error-free computations. Since the aim is to entrench computer simulations as a technological singularity, the entire analysis must be careful to keep human agents out of the picture.",2017,2022-01-30 4:59:44,2022-01-30 4:59:44,2020-11-24 2:59:54,167-179,,,,,,,The Frontiers Collection,,,,Springer,"Berlin, Heidelberg",en,,,,,Springer Link,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: 4  DOI: 10.1007/978-3-662-54033-6_9,,,,MetaSafety; Other-org,Computer Simulation; Empirical Science; Epistemic Justification; Reliable Process; Target System,"Callaghan, Victor; Miller, James; Yampolskiy, Roman; Armstrong, Stuart",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IP law concerns the ownership of expressions of ideas, and not ideas themselves. Given the nature and trajectory of converging technologies, IP laws as they currently exist may impede the development of such technologies. Examples of “patent thickets” that appear to impede other rapidly evolving technologies already abound (as in the smartphone arena). Patents and copyrights may pose even more intriguing problems once the singularity is achieved because our notions of who may own what will likely radically change. Will artificial intelligences, for example, compete with us over rights to create, and will we be legally or morally precluded from ownership rights in technologies that make such agents function?

We are all subject to sickness and accident, to bad luck and unfair breaks, and above all to death as a final end to all our endeavours. In order to compensate for these disappointments and for our ultimate inability to overcome these very real and material constraints we phantasise, we dream, we create, and/or we nurse our bruised and fragile selves by hoping that our phantasies might come true, if not for ourselves then for our offspring. The singularity, as it is most commonly expressed, concerns the possibility of overcoming death by achieving a sort of immortality. In specific terms Kurtweil’s own discussion of the singularity is concerned with the possibility of ‘resurrecting’ his dead father in virtual space at least. There is consistently throughout the writings on the singularity a dismissal of the emotional aspect of human living in favour of the rational overcoming of our existential condition. I am arguing that we cannot ignore the emotional consciousness that is the bedrock of human existence and that we ignore our unconscious feelings at our peril. I think that the singularity as it is being developed is actually a direct threat to the flourishing of human beings and human society because the emotional shortcomings of the theory have not been recognised.",2017,2022-01-30 4:59:33,2022-01-30 4:59:33,2020-11-24 3:00:00,209-220,,,,,,A Psychoanalytic Approach to the Singularity,The Frontiers Collection,,,,Springer,"Berlin, Heidelberg",en,,,,,Springer Link,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: 1  DOI: 10.1007/978-3-662-54033-6_12,,,,MetaSafety; Other-org,Affective Computing; Computer Agent; Emotional Intelligence; Emotional Relationship; Technological Singularity,"Callaghan, Victor; Miller, James; Yampolskiy, Roman; Armstrong, Stuart",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we question the appropriateness of using language of certainty with respect to efforts to manage that risk. We begin by establishing a very general formalism to characterize agentic behavior and to describe standards of acceptable behavior. We show that determination of whether an agent meets any particular standard is not computable. We discuss the extent of the burden associated with verification by manual proof and by automated behavioral governance. We show that to ensure decidability of the behavioral standard itself, one must further limit the capabilities of the agent. We then demonstrate that if our concerns relate to outcomes in the physical world, attempts at validation are futile. Finally, we show that layered architectures aimed at making these challenges tractable mistakenly equate intentions with actions or outcomes, thereby failing to provide any guarantees. We conclude with a discussion of why language of certainty should be eradicated from the conversation about the safety of general artificial intelligence.",2018,2022-01-30 4:59:59,2022-01-30 4:59:59,2020-12-13 20:00:55,225-234,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000008[s0]  arXiv: 1604.06963,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BXXTPQ43/Jilk - 2016 - Limits to Verification and Validation of Agentic B.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/WTZWJK5S/1604.html,,TechSafety; Other-org,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; I.2.0; F.3.1; K.4.1; D.2.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Named after the year in which the programme first went to air, The ’51 Society was produced by the BBC Home Service at their Manchester studio and ran for several years. A presentation by the week’s guest would be followed by a panel discussion. Regulars on the panel included Max Newman, Professor of Mathematics at Manchester, the philosopher Michael Polanyi, then Professor of Social Studies at Manchester, and the mathematician Peter Hilton, a younger member of Newman’s department at Manchester who had worked with Turing and Newman at Bletchley Park. Turing’s target in ‘Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory’ is the claim that ‘You cannot make a machine to think for you’ (p. 472). A common theme in his writing is that if a machine is to be intelligent, then it will need to ‘learn by experience’ (probably with some pre-selection, by an external educator, of the experiences to which the machine will be subjected). The present article continues the discussion of machine learning begun in Chapters 10 and 11. Turing remarks that the ‘human analogy alone’ suggests that a process of education ‘would in practice be an essential to the production of a reasonably intelligent machine within a reasonably short space of time’ (p. 473). He emphasizes the point, also made in Chapter 11, that one might ‘start from a comparatively simple machine, and, by subjecting it to a suitable range of ‘‘experience’’ transform it into one which was more elaborate, and was able to deal with a far greater range of contingencies’ (p. 473). Turing goes on to give some indication of how learning might be accomplished, introducing the idea of a machine’s building up what he calls ‘indexes of experiences’ (p. 474). (This idea is not mentioned elsewhere in his writings.) An example of an index of experiences is a list (ordered in some way) of situations in which the machine has found itself, coupled with the action that was taken, and the outcome, good or bad. The situations are described in terms of features.",2004-09-09,2022-01-30 4:59:58,2022-01-30 4:59:58,2020-11-22 5:05:23,,,,,,,,,,,,Oxford University Press,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: 0000011  DOI: 10.1093/oso/9780198250791.003.0018,,,,TechSafety; Other-org,,,,,,,"Turing, Alan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

General behaviours of change agents towards relevant technological research and development are discussed with a view to the economic and social implications. The interactions of key change agents can assist in the determination of future paths towards a singularity event or possibly even an ‘anti-singularity event’.

The ability for an AI to better itself over time through a process called recursive self-improvement has been considered as a promising path to creating the technological singularity. In this type of system an AI has access to its own source code and possibly even hardware, with the ability to edit both at will. This gives the AI the option to constantly improve upon itself and become increasingly intelligent. Eventually this would produce versions of the AI that are more intelligent than humans and cause us to reach the technological singularity. Researchers have speculated that this process could create an extremely dangerous situation for humanity as we get left behind in a growing intelligence gap. This chapter proposes that this gap would not be as drastic as initially thought, and that there may be natural limits on the ability for an AI to improve upon itself. Along the way we will propose that the law of diminishing returns will take effect to limit runaway intelligence. We also theorize that developing and manufacturing new hardware will introduce a latency in AI improvement that could easily be exploited to halt any dangerous situation.",2017,2022-01-30 4:59:46,2022-01-30 4:59:46,2020-11-24 2:59:49,141-152,,,,,,,The Frontiers Collection,,,,Springer,"Berlin, Heidelberg",en,,,,,Springer Link,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: 3  DOI: 10.1007/978-3-662-54033-6_7,,,,MetaSafety; AmbiguosSafety; Other-org,Technological Singularity; Cognitive Algorithm; Hardware Improvement; Inductive Logic Programming; Logistical Chain,"Callaghan, Victor; Miller, James; Yampolskiy, Roman; Armstrong, Stuart",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But this task proved more difficult than expected. As the years passed, AI researchers gradually shifted focus to producing AI systems that intelligently approached specific tasks in relatively narrow domains. In recent years, however, more and more AI researchers have recognized the necessity – and the feasibility – of returning to the original goal of the field. Increasingly, there is a call to focus less on highly specialized ‘narrow AI’ problem solving systems, and more on confronting the difficult issues involved in creating ‘human-level intelligence’, and ultimately general intelligence that goes beyond the human level in various ways. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), as this renewed focus has come to be called, attempts to study and reproduce intelligence as a whole in a domain independent way. Encouraged by the recent success of several smaller-scale AGI-related meetings and special tracks at conferences, the initiative to organize the very first international conference on AGI was taken, with the goal to give researchers in the field an opportunity to present relevant research results and to exchange ideas on topics of common interest.

For this paper, an AI system is a system that “has goals which it tries to accomplish by acting in the world”, i.e. it assumes that the system is <@goal-directed@>(@Intuitions about goal-directed behavior@).

It starts by arguing that a sufficiently powerful goal-directed AI system will want to self-improve, as that could help it achieve its goals better in the (presumably long) future. In particular, it will want to become “rational”, in the sense that it will want to maximize its _expected_ utility, where the utility function is determined by its goal. (The justification for this is the VNM theorem, and the various Dutch book arguments that support Bayesianism and expected utility maximization.)

However, not all modifications would be good for the AI system. In particular, it will very strongly want to preserve its utility function, as that determines what it will (try to) accomplish in the future, and any change in the utility function would be a disaster from the perspective of the current utility function. Similarly, it will want to protect itself from harm, that is, it has a survival incentive, because it can’t accomplish its goal if it’s dead.

The final instrumental subgoal is to acquire resources and use them efficiently in pursuit of its goal, because almost by definition resources are useful for a wide variety of goals, including (probably) the AI system’s goal."

Recent work calls this into question for neural networks and other over-parameterized models, for which it is often observed that larger models generalize better. We provide a simple explanation for this by measuring the bias and variance of neural networks: while the bias is monotonically decreasing as in the classical theory, the variance is unimodal or bell-shaped: it increases then decreases with the width of the network. We vary the network architecture, loss function, and choice of dataset and confirm that variance unimodality occurs robustly for all models we considered. The risk curve is the sum of the bias and variance curves and displays different qualitative shapes depending on the relative scale of bias and variance, with the double descent curve observed in recent literature as a special case. We corroborate these empirical results with a theoretical analysis of two-layer linear networks with random first layer. Finally, evaluation on out-of-distribution data shows that most of the drop in accuracy comes from increased bias while variance increases by a relatively small amount. Moreover, we find that deeper models decrease bias and increase variance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.",2020-12-07,2022-01-30 4:47:35,2022-01-30 4:47:35,2021-11-13 14:19:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000061  arXiv: 2002.11328,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/7J95438X/Yang et al. - 2020 - Rethinking Bias-Variance Trade-off for Generalizat.pdf,,UnsortedSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ICML 2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Widely used Linear Programming (LP) relaxations only work well when networks are trained to facilitate verification. This precludes applications that involve verification-agnostic networks, i.e., networks not specially trained for verification. On the other hand, semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have successfully be applied to verification-agnostic networks, but do not currently scale beyond small networks due to poor time and space asymptotics. In this work, we propose a first-order dual SDP algorithm that (1) requires memory only linear in the total number of network activations, (2) only requires a fixed number of forward/backward passes through the network per iteration. By exploiting iterative eigenvector methods, we express all solver operations in terms of forward and backward passes through the network, enabling efficient use of hardware like GPUs/TPUs. For two verification-agnostic networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10, we significantly improve L-inf verified robust accuracy from 1% to 88% and 6% to 40% respectively.

In standard multi-task RL settings, low-reward data collected while trying to solve one task provides little to no signal for solving that particular task and is hence effectively wasted. However, we argue that this data, which is uninformative for one task, is likely a rich source of information for other tasks. To leverage this insight and efficiently reuse data, we present Generalized Hindsight: an approximate inverse reinforcement learning technique for relabeling behaviors with the right tasks. Intuitively, given a behavior generated under one task, Generalized Hindsight returns a different task that the behavior is better suited for. Then, the behavior is relabeled with this new task before being used by an off-policy RL optimizer. Compared to standard relabeling techniques, Generalized Hindsight provides a substantially more efficient reuse of samples, which we empirically demonstrate on a suite of multi-task navigation and manipulation tasks.

We conducted two online experiments and one in-person think-aloud study to evaluate two currently common techniques for evaluating XAI systems: (1) using proxy, artificial tasks such as how well humans predict the AI's decision from the given explanations, and (2) using subjective measures of trust and preference as predictors of actual performance. The results of our experiments demonstrate that evaluations with proxy tasks did not predict the results of the evaluations with the actual decision-making tasks. Further, the subjective measures on evaluations with actual decision-making tasks did not predict the objective performance on those same tasks.

Our learning algorithm is a mirror descent over policies: in each iteration, it safely lifts a symbolic policy into the neurosymbolic space, performs safe gradient updates to the resulting policy, and projects the updated policy into the safe symbolic subset, all without requiring explicit verification of neural networks.

Despite significant algorithmic contributions in recent years, IRL remains an ill-posed problem at its core; multiple reward functions coincide with the observed behavior and the actual reward function is not identifiable without prior knowledge or supplementary information. This paper presents an IRL framework called Bayesian optimization-IRL (BO-IRL) which identifies multiple solutions that are consistent with the expert demonstrations by efficiently exploring the reward function space. BO-IRL achieves this by utilizing Bayesian Optimization along with our newly proposed kernel that (a) projects the parameters of policy invariant reward functions to a single point in a latent space and (b) ensures nearby points in the latent space correspond to reward functions yielding similar likelihoods. This projection allows the use of standard stationary kernels in the latent space to capture the correlations present across the reward function space.

The reasons for this remain unclear. When using standard supervised methods (e.g., for bandits), on-policy data collection provides ""hard negatives"" that correct the model in precisely those states and actions that the policy is likely to visit. We call this phenomenon ""corrective feedback."" We show that bootstrapping-based Q-learning algorithms do not necessarily benefit from this corrective feedback, and training on the experience collected by the algorithm is not sufficient to correct errors in the Q-function. In fact, Q-learning and related methods can exhibit pathological interactions between the distribution of experience collected by the agent and the policy induced by training on that experience, leading to potential instability, sub-optimal convergence, and poor results when learning from noisy, sparse or delayed rewards. We demonstrate the existence of this problem, both theoretically and empirically. We then show that a specific correction to the data distribution can mitigate this issue. Based on these observations, we propose a new algorithm, DisCor, which computes an approximation to this optimal distribution and uses it to re-weight the transitions used for training, resulting in substantial improvements in a range of challenging RL settings, such as multi-task learning and learning from noisy reward signals.

To overcome this challenge, we design a mechanism for defining the learning environment of each agent for which we know that the optimal solution for the global objective coincides with a Nash equilibrium strategy profile of the agents optimizing their own local objectives. The society functions as an economy of agents that learn the credit assignment process itself by buying and selling to each other the right to operate on the environment state.

IRL is motivated by situations where knowledge of the rewards is a goal by itself (as in preference elicitation) and by the task of apprenticeship learning (learning policies from an expert). In this paper we show how to combine prior knowledge and evidence from the expert’s actions to derive a probability distribution over the space of reward functions.

In this paper, we consider how formal verification techniques developed for traditional software systems can be repurposed for verification of reinforcement learning-enabled ones, a particularly important class of machine learning systems. Rather than enforcing safety by examining and altering the structure of a complex neural network implementation, our technique uses blackbox methods to synthesizes deterministic programs, simpler, more interpretable, approximations of the network that can nonetheless guarantee desired safety properties are preserved, even when the network is deployed in unanticipated or previously unobserved environments. Our methodology frames the problem of neural network verification in terms of a counterexample and syntax-guided inductive synthesis procedure over these programs. The synthesis procedure searches for both a deterministic program and an inductive invariant over an infinite state transition system that represents a specification of an application's control logic. Additional specifications defining environment-based constraints can also be provided to further refine the search space. Synthesized programs deployed in conjunction with a neural network implementation dynamically enforce safety conditions by monitoring and preventing potentially unsafe actions proposed by neural policies.

This is especially true for tasks such as training an agent to play StarCraft II, a real-time strategy game where reward is only given at the end of a game which is usually very long. While this problem can be addressed through reward shaping, such approaches typically require a human expert with specialized knowledge. Inspired by the vision of enabling reward shaping through the more-accessible paradigm of natural-language narration, we develop a technique that can provide the benefits of reward shaping using natural language commands. Our narration-guided RL agent projects sequences of natural-language commands into the same high-dimensional representation space as corresponding goal states.

It is common to measure the performance of a supervised machine learning algorithm by plotting its ""learning curve"", that is, the decay of the error rate as a function of the number of training examples. However, the classical theoretical framework for understanding learnability, the PAC model of Vapnik-Chervonenkis and Valiant, does not explain the behavior of learning curves: the distribution-free PAC model of learning can only bound the upper envelope of the learning curves over all possible data distributions. This does not match the practice of machine learning, where the data source is typically fixed in any given scenario, while the learner may choose the number of training examples on the basis of factors such as computational resources and desired accuracy. In this paper, we study an alternative learning model that better captures such practical aspects of machine learning, but still gives rise to a complete theory of the learnable in the spirit of the PAC model. More precisely, we consider the problem of universal learning, which aims to understand the performance of learning algorithms on every data distribution, but without requiring uniformity over the distribution. The main result of this paper is a remarkable trichotomy: there are only three possible rates of universal learning. More precisely, we show that the learning curves of any given concept class decay either at an exponential, linear, or arbitrarily slow rates. Moreover, each of these cases is completely characterized by appropriate combinatorial parameters, and we exhibit optimal learning algorithms that achieve the best possible rate in each case.

Since machines powered by artificial intelligence are playing an ever greater role in our lives, it will be important to equip them with the capabilities necessary to cooperate and to foster cooperation. We see an opportunity for the field of artificial intelligence to explicitly focus effort on this class of problems, which we term Cooperative AI. The objective of this research would be to study the many aspects of the problems of cooperation and to innovate in AI to contribute to solving these problems. Central goals include building machine agents with the capabilities needed for cooperation, building tools to foster cooperation in populations of (machine and/or human) agents, and otherwise conducting AI research for insight relevant to problems of cooperation.

However, in reality, people make many important decisions under uncertainty. To better understand preference learning in these cases, we study the setting of inverse decision theory (IDT), a previously proposed framework where a human is observed making non-sequential binary decisions under uncertainty. In IDT, the human's preferences are conveyed through their loss function, which expresses a tradeoff between different types of mistakes. We give the first statistical analysis of IDT, providing conditions necessary to identify these preferences and characterizing the sample complexity -- the number of decisions that must be observed to learn the tradeoff the human is making to a desired precision. Interestingly, we show that it is actually easier to identify preferences when the decision problem is more uncertain. Furthermore, uncertain decision problems allow us to relax the unrealistic assumption that the human is an optimal decision maker but still identify their exact preferences; we give sample complexities in this suboptimal case as well. Our analysis contradicts the intuition that partial observability should make preference learning more difficult. It also provides a first step towards understanding and improving preference learning methods for uncertain and suboptimal humans.",2021-10-28,2022-01-30 4:51:11,2022-01-30 4:51:11,2021-11-18 23:19:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000000  arXiv: 2106.10394,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9KSDNPMR/Laidlaw and Russell - 2021 - Uncertain Decisions Facilitate Better Preference L.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/PRVT74B5/2106.html,,TechSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, these systems are now being incorporated into commercial products. With this comes an additional challenge: how can we build AI systems that solve tasks where there is not a crisp, well-defined specification? While multiple solutions have been proposed, in this competition we focus on one in particular: learning from human feedback. Rather than training AI systems using a predefined reward function or using a labeled dataset with a predefined set of categories, we instead train the AI system using a learning signal derived from some form of human feedback, which can evolve over time as the understanding of the task changes, or as the capabilities of the AI system improve. The MineRL BASALT competition aims to spur forward research on this important class of techniques. We design a suite of four tasks in Minecraft for which we expect it will be hard to write down hardcoded reward functions. These tasks are defined by a paragraph of natural language: for example, ""create a waterfall and take a scenic picture of it"", with additional clarifying details. Participants must train a separate agent for each task, using any method they want. Agents are then evaluated by humans who have read the task description. To help participants get started, we provide a dataset of human demonstrations on each of the four tasks, as well as an imitation learning baseline that leverages these demonstrations. Our hope is that this competition will improve our ability to build AI systems that do what their designers intend them to do, even when the intent cannot be easily formalized.

Such approaches can fail when people are themselves learning about what they want. In this work, we introduce the assistive multi-armed bandit, where a robot assists a human playing a bandit task to maximize cumulative reward. In this problem, the human does not know the reward function but can learn it through the rewards received from arm pulls; the robot only observes which arms the human pulls but not the reward associated with each pull. We offer sufficient and necessary conditions for successfully assisting the human in this framework. Surprisingly, better human performance in isolation does not necessarily lead to better performance when assisted by the robot: a human policy can do better by effectively communicating its observed rewards to the robot.

As the capabilities of AI systems improve, it is important to ensure that such systems do not adopt subgoals that prevent a human from switching them off. This is a challenge because many formulations of rational agents create strong incentives for self-preservation. This is not caused by a built-in instinct, but because a rational agent will maximize expected utility and cannot achieve whatever objective it has been given if it is dead. Our goal is to study the incentives an agent has to allow itself to be switched off. We analyze a simple game between a human H and a robot R, where H can press R’s off switch but R can disable the off switch. A traditional agent takes its reward function for granted: we show that such agents have an incentive to disable the off switch, except in the special case where H is perfectly rational. Our key insight is that for R to want to preserve its off switch, it needs to be uncertain about the utility associated with the outcome, and to treat H’s actions as important observations about that utility. (R also has no incentive to switch itself off in this setting.) We conclude that giving machines an appropriate level of uncertainty about their objectives leads to safer designs, and we argue that this setting is a useful generalization of the classical AI paradigm of rational agents.",2017,2022-01-30 4:51:10,2022-01-30 4:51:10,2019-07-08 15:30:25,220-227,,,,,,,,,,,International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Organization,"Melbourne, Australia",en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: 0000086,,,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Twenty-Sixth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This rewards precise reproduction of demonstrations in one particular environment, but provides little information about how robustly an algorithm can generalise the demonstrator’s intent to substantially different deployment settings. This paper presents the MAGICAL benchmark suite, which permits systematic evaluation of generalisation by quantifying robustness to different kinds of distribution shift that an IL algorithm is likely to encounter in practice. Using the MAGICAL suite, we conﬁrm that existing IL algorithms overﬁt signiﬁcantly to the context in which demonstrations are provided. We also show that standard methods for reducing overﬁtting are effective at creating narrow perceptual invariances, but are not sufﬁcient to enable transfer to contexts that require substantially different behaviour, which suggests that new approaches will be needed in order to robustly generalise demonstrator intent.

But, we humans are not perfect and we may give orders that are not best aligned to our preferences. We show that when a human is not perfectly rational then a robot that tries to infer and act according to the human's underlying preferences can always perform better than a robot that simply follows the human's literal order. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the obedience of a robot and the value it can attain for its owner. We investigate how this tradeoff is impacted by the way the robot infers the human's preferences, showing that some methods err more on the side of obedience than others. We then analyze how performance degrades when the robot has a misspecified model of the features that the human cares about or the level of rationality of the human. Finally, we study how robots can start detecting such model misspecification.

In settings where multiple robots act in separate environments, a single human operator can manage a fleet of robots by identifying and teleoperating one robot at any given time. The key challenge is that users have limited attention: as the number of robots increases, users lose the ability to decide which robot requires teleoperation the most. Our goal is to automate this decision, thereby enabling users to supervise more robots than their attention would normally allow for. Our insight is that we can model the user's choice of which robot to control as an approximately optimal decision that maximizes the user's utility function. We learn a model of the user's preferences from observations of the user's choices in easy settings with a few robots, and use it in challenging settings with more robots to automatically identify which robot the user would most likely choose to control, if they were able to evaluate the states of all robots at all times.

By treating these separate reward functions as observations about the underlying true reward, we derive an approach to infer a common reward across all environments.

We show that our method is faster, easier to use, and produces a higher quality solution than the typical method of designing a reward jointly across all environments. We additionally conduct a series of experiments that measure the sensitivity of these results to different properties of the reward design task, such as the number of environments, the number of feasible solutions per environment, and the fraction of the total features that vary within each environment.

The goal is often unknown ex-ante, so prior work enables agents to infer the goal from user input and assist with the task. Such methods tend to assume some combination of knowledge of the dynamics of the environment, the user’s policy given their goal, and the set of possible goals the user might target, which limits their application to real-world scenarios. We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework for model-free shared autonomy that lifts these assumptions. We use human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning with neural network function approximation to learn an end-to-end mapping from environmental observation and user input to agent action values, with task reward as the only form of supervision. This approach poses the challenge of following user commands closely enough to provide the user with real-time action feedback and thereby ensure high-quality user input, but also deviating from the user’s actions when they are suboptimal. We balance these two needs by discarding actions whose values fall below some threshold, then selecting the remaining action closest to the user’s input. Controlled studies with users (n = 12) and synthetic pilots playing a video game, and a pilot study with users (n = 4) ﬂying a real quadrotor, demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to assist users with real-time control tasks in which the agent cannot directly access the user’s private information through observations, but receives a reward signal and user input that both depend on the user’s intent. The agent learns to assist the user without access to this private information, implicitly inferring it from the user’s input. This enables the assisted user to complete the task more effectively than the user or an autonomous agent could on their own. This paper is a proof of concept that illustrates the potential for deep reinforcement learning to enable ﬂexible and practical assistive systems.",2018-02-05,2022-01-30 4:51:09,2022-01-30 4:51:09,2019-07-12 0:10:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000087  arXiv: 1802.01744,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/6HMCX5IQ/Reddy et al. - 2018 - Shared Autonomy via Deep Reinforcement Learning.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/KS26B5X8/1802.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/FWIRNIMR/1802.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/P49DC639/Reddy et al. - 2018 - Shared Autonomy via Deep Reinforcement Learning.pdf,,CHAI; TechSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Robotics; Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Robotics: Science and Systems XIV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the multi-agent setting, a DRL agent’s policy can easily get stuck in a poor local optima w.r.t. its training partners – the learned policy may be only locally optimal to other agents’ current policies. In this paper, we focus on the problem of training robust DRL agents with continuous actions in the multi-agent learning setting so that the trained agents can still generalize when its opponents’ policies alter. To tackle this problem, we proposed a new algorithm, MiniMax Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (M3DDPG) with the following contributions: (1) we introduce a minimax extension of the popular multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (MADDPG), for robust policy learning; (2) since the continuous action space leads to computational intractability in our minimax learning objective, we propose Multi-Agent Adversarial Learning (MAAL) to efﬁciently solve our proposed formulation.

We consider agents that \emph{care only about consensus}: that is, (a) an agent's utility depends only on the consensus value achieved (and not, for example, on the number of messages the agent sends) and (b) agents strictly prefer reaching consensus to not reaching consensus. We show that, under these assumptions, there is no \emph{ex post Nash Equilibrium}, even with only one failure. Roughly speaking, this means that there must always exist a \emph{failure pattern} (a description of who fails, when they fail, and which agents they do not send messages to in the round that they fail) and initial preferences for which an agent can gain by deviating. On the other hand, if we assume that there is a distribution $\pi$ on the failure patterns and initial preferences, then under minimal assumptions on $\pi$, there is a Nash equilibrium that tolerates $f$ failures (i.e., $\pi$ puts probability 1 on there being at most $f$ failures) if $f+1 < n$ (where $n$ is the total number of agents). Moreover, we show that a slight extension of the Nash equilibrium strategy is also a \emph{sequential} equilibrium (under the same assumptions about the distribution $\pi$).",2016,2022-01-30 4:51:08,2022-01-30 4:51:08,2020-12-17 22:22:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000022  arXiv: 2005.10141,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/5MCJDWZ2/Halpern and Vilaca - 2020 - Rational Consensus.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/MAM8FX3J/2005.html,,CHAI; TechSafety; AmbiguosSafety,"Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory; Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016 ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior work has evaluated learned reward functions by examining rollouts from a policy optimized for the learned reward. However, this method cannot distinguish between the learned reward function failing to reflect user preferences, and the reinforcement learning algorithm failing to optimize the learned reward. Moreover, the rollout method is highly sensitive to details of the environment the learned reward is evaluated in, which often differ in the deployment environment. To address these problems, we introduce the Equivalent-Policy Invariant Comparison (EPIC) distance to quantify the difference between two reward functions directly, without training a policy. We prove EPIC is invariant on an equivalence class of reward functions that always induce the same optimal policy. Furthermore, we find EPIC can be precisely approximated and is more robust than baselines to the choice of visitation distribution. Finally, we find that the EPIC distance of learned reward functions to the ground-truth reward is predictive of the success of training a policy, even in different transition dynamics.",2020-06-24,2022-01-30 4:51:08,2022-01-30 4:51:08,2020-08-31 17:51:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000007  arXiv: 2006.13900,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/QZKBAKKJ/Gleave et al. - 2020 - Quantifying Differences in Reward Functions.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/SRRD2J53/2006.html,,CHAI; TechSafety; DeepMind,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; I.2.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ICLR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mixed-motive environments typically studied have a single cooperative outcome on which all agents can agree. Many real-world multi-agent environments are instead bargaining problems (BPs): they have several Pareto-optimal payoff profiles over which agents have conflicting preferences. We argue that typical cooperation-inducing learning algorithms fail to cooperate in BPs when there is room for normative disagreement resulting in the existence of multiple competing cooperative equilibria, and illustrate this problem empirically. To remedy the issue, we introduce the notion of norm-adaptive policies. Norm-adaptive policies are capable of behaving according to different norms in different circumstances, creating opportunities for resolving normative disagreement. We develop a class of norm-adaptive policies and show in experiments that these significantly increase cooperation.

Unfortunately, these models cannot capture the full complexity of human behavior and necessarily introduce simplifying assumptions. As a result, predictions may degrade whenever the observed human behavior departs from the assumed structure, which can have negative implications for safety. In this paper, we observe that how ""rational"" human actions appear under a particular model can be viewed as an indicator of that model's ability to describe the human's current motion. By reasoning about this model confidence in a real-time Bayesian framework, we show that the robot can very quickly modulate its predictions to become more uncertain when the model performs poorly. Building on recent work in provably-safe trajectory planning, we leverage these confidence-aware human motion predictions to generate assured autonomous robot motion.

It is easy to forget these preferences, since these preferences are already satisﬁed in our environment. This motivates our key insight: when a robot is deployed in an environment that humans act in, the state of the environment is already optimized for what humans want. We can therefore use this implicit preference information from the state to ﬁll in the blanks. We develop an algorithm based on Maximum Causal Entropy IRL and use it to evaluate the idea in a suite of proof-of-concept environments designed to show its properties.

In robotics, value alignment is key to the design of collaborative robots that can integrate into human workﬂows, successfully inferring and adapting to their users’ objectives as they go. We argue that a meaningful solution to value alignment must combine multi-agent decision theory with rich mathematical models of human cognition, enabling robots to tap into people’s natural collaborative capabilities. We present a solution to the cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL) dynamic game based on well-established cognitive models of decision making and theory of mind. The solution captures a key reciprocity relation: the human will not plan her actions in isolation, but rather reason pedagogically about how the robot might learn from them; the robot, in turn, can anticipate this and interpret the human’s actions pragmatically. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the ﬁrst formal analysis of value alignment grounded in empirically validated cognitive models.",2020,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2019-12-18 1:15:26,49-57,,,10,,,,,,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s2]  ACC: 47,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/ZADVEM2M/Fisac et al. - 2018 - Pragmatic-Pedagogic Value Alignment.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/IJB43GBG/1707.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/NAHBPPDH/1707.html,,CHAI; TechSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Robotics; I.2.0; I.2.6; Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction; 68T05; I.2.8; I.2.9,"Amato, Nancy M.; Hager, Greg; Thomas, Shawna; Torres-Torriti, Miguel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This tends to result in defensive and opaque behaviors. Our key insight is that an autonomous car’s actions will actually affect what other cars will do in response, whether the car is aware of it or not. Our thesis is that we can leverage these responses to plan more efﬁcient and communicative behaviors. We model the interaction between an autonomous car and a human driver as a dynamical system, in which the robot’s actions have immediate consequences on the state of the car, but also on human actions. We model these consequences by approximating the human as an optimal planner, with a reward function that we acquire through Inverse Reinforcement Learning. When the robot plans with this reward function in this dynamical system, it comes up with actions that purposefully change human state: it merges in front of a human to get them to slow down or to reach its own goal faster; it blocks two lanes to get them to switch to a third lane; or it backs up slightly at an intersection to get them to proceed ﬁrst. Such behaviors arise from the optimization, without relying on hand-coded signaling strategies and without ever explicitly modeling communication. Our user study results suggest that the robot is indeed capable of eliciting desired changes in human state by planning using this dynamical system.",2016,2022-01-30 4:51:06,2022-01-30 4:51:06,2020-12-13 23:37:50,,,,,,,,,,,,Robotics: Science and Systems Foundation,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: 0000363,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/KQ9WS3I7/SadighPlanning2016.pdf,,CHAI; TechSafety; AmbiguosSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Robotics: Science and Systems 2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper contributes a first approach toward enforcing formal safety constraints on end-to-end policies with visual inputs. Our approach draws on recent advances in object detection and automated reasoning for hybrid dynamical systems. The approach is evaluated on a novel benchmark that emphasizes the challenge of safely exploring in the presence of hard constraints. Our benchmark draws from several proposed problem sets for safe learning and includes problems that emphasize challenges such as reward signals that are not aligned with safety constraints. On each of these benchmark problems, our algorithm completely avoids unsafe behavior while remaining competitive at optimizing for as much reward as is safe.

Our model captures the potentially mismatched priorities among a hierarchy of policy-makers (e.g., federal, state, and local governments) with respect to two main cost components that have opposite dependence on the policy strength, such as post-intervention infection rates and the cost of policy implementation. Our model further includes a crucial third factor in decisions: a cost of non-compliance with the policy-maker immediately above in the hierarchy, such as non-compliance of state with federal policies. Our first contribution is a closed-form approximation of a recently published agent-based model to compute the number of infections for any implemented policy. Second, we present a novel equilibrium selection criterion that addresses common issues with equilibrium multiplicity in our setting. Third, we propose a hierarchical algorithm based on best response dynamics for computing an approximate equilibrium of the hierarchical policy-making game consistent with our solution concept.

Since accurately modeling the human behavior a priori is challenging, such models are often parameterized, enabling the robot to adapt predictions based on observations by maintaining a distribution over the model parameters. This leads to a probabilistic prediction problem, which even though attractive, can be computationally demanding. In this work, we formalize the prediction problem as a stochastic reachability problem in the joint state space of the human and the belief over the model parameters. We further introduce a Hamilton-Jacobi reachability framework which casts a deterministic approximation of this stochastic reachability problem by restricting the allowable actions to a set rather than a distribution, while still maintaining the belief as an explicit state. This leads to two advantages: our approach gives rise to a novel predictor wherein the predictions can be performed at a significantly lower computational expense, and to a general framework which also enables us to perform predictor analysis. We compare our approach to a fully stochastic predictor using Bayesian inference and the worst-case forward reachable set in simulation and in hardware, and demonstrate how it can enable robust planning while not being overly conservative, even when the human model is inaccurate.",2019-10-29,2022-01-30 4:50:42,2022-01-30 4:50:42,2019-12-18 2:35:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000003[s0]  arXiv: 1910.13369,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/XESDVH7I/Bansal et al. - 2019 - A Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability-Based Framework for.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/NAM8GA7X/1910.html,,CHAI; TechSafety; AmbiguosSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Robotics; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is substantial overlap between different sets of principles, with widespread agreement that AI should be used for the common good, should not be used to harm people or undermine their rights, and should respect widely held values such as fairness, privacy, and autonomy. While articulating and agreeing on principles is important, it is only a starting point. Drawing on comparisons with the field of bioethics, we highlight some of the limitations of principles: in particular, they are often too broad and high-level to guide ethics in practice. We suggest that an important next step for the field of AI ethics is to focus on exploring the tensions that inevitably arise as we try to implement principles in practice. By explicitly recognising these tensions we can begin to make decisions about how they should be resolved in specific cases, and develop frameworks and guidelines for AI ethics that are rigorous and practically relevant.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been identified as one such transformative technology. Many of its impacts may require global governance responses. However, what are the direct and indirect effects of AI technologies on the viability, form, or functioning of the international legal order itself? What, if any, are the prospects, peril or promise of AI-driven legal automation at the international level? This paper draws on an ‘AI Governance Disruption’ framework to understanding AI’s impacts on the global governance architecture. Focusing particularly on the potential for legal automation at the international law level, it explores three potential pathways of such ‘legal displacement’: (1) the automation of rule creation and arbitration; (2) the automation of monitoring & enforcement; or (3) the ‘replacement’ of international law with new architectural modes of (international) behaviour control. It then focuses on the effects of these trends on the architecture of international law. It distinguishes 10 different roles that AI applications could play, with distinct effects on the international legal order. That is, AI systems can serve as (1) legal ‘canary in the coal mine’, highlighting the need for greater cross-regime harmonization. However, it can also serve as (2) tough knot or (3) generator of regime fault lines. Under even modest scenarios of legal automation, AI systems may serve variably as a (4) shield, (5) patch, (6) cure, or (7) accelerator of international legal fragmentation. Finally, AI tools may serve as (8) differential enabler; (9) driver of value shifts, or (10) asymmetric weapon, potentially contributing to trends of contestation or erosion in the international legal order. The paper concludes with a brief review of the ways in which international lawyers or regime scholars might approach the risks and opportunities of increasing automation in international law, in order to leverage these trends and tools towards improved efficacy, resilience, and legitimacy of global governance.",2021-03,2022-01-30 4:50:24,2022-01-30 4:50:24,2021-10-31 16:58:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: 0000000,,"/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/EZ5UBQGN/Maas - 2021 - AI, Governance Displacement, and the (De)Fragmenta.pdf",,MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,International Studies Association 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, when one or both of the observation models are misspeciﬁed, the distributions will conﬂict. We study this problem in the setting with two conﬂicting reward functions learned from different sources. In such a setting, we would like to retreat to a broader distribution over reward functions, in order to mitigate the effects of misspeciﬁcation. We assume that an agent will maximize expected reward given this distribution over reward functions, and identify four desiderata for this setting. We propose a novel algorithm, Multitask Inverse Reward Design (MIRD), and compare it to a range of simple baselines. While all methods must trade off between conservatism and informativeness, through a combination of theory and empirical results on a toy environment, we ﬁnd that MIRD and its variant MIRD-IF strike a good balance between the two.",2019,2022-01-30 4:50:07,2022-01-30 4:50:07,,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: 0000000[s0],,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/J9RMVNK6/Krasheninnikov et al. - Combining reward information from multiple sources.pdf,,CHAI; TechSafety; BERI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NeurIPS 2019 workshop on Learning with Rich Experience: Integration of Learning Paradigms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate the existence of adversarial policies in zero-sum games between simulated humanoid robots with proprioceptive observations, against state-of-the-art victims trained via self-play to be robust to opponents. The adversarial policies reliably win against the victims but generate seemingly random and uncoordinated behavior.

In this paper we study value-based reinforcement learning algorithms in the Newcomblike setting, and answer some of the fundamental theoretical questions about the behaviour of such algorithms in these environments. We show that a value-based reinforcement learning agent cannot converge to a policy that is not ratifiable, i.e., does not only choose actions that are optimal given that policy. This gives us a powerful tool for reasoning about the limit behaviour of agents – for example, it lets us show that there are Newcomblike environments in which a reinforcement learning agent cannot converge to any optimal policy. We show that a ratifiable policy always exists in our setting, but that there are cases in which a reinforcement learning agent normally cannot converge to it (and hence cannot converge at all).

For many tasks, however, the best available proxy objective is only a rough approximation of the designer’s intentions. When given such a goal, a system that optimizes the proxy objective tends to select degenerate solutions where the proxy reward is very different from the designer’s true reward function. One way to counteract the tendency toward speciﬁcation-gaming is quantilization, a method that interpolates between imitating demonstrations, and optimizing the proxy objective. If the demonstrations are of adequate quality, and the proxy reward overestimates performance, then quantilization has better guaranteed performance than other strategies. However, if the proxy reward underestimates performance, then either imitation or optimization will offer the best guarantee. This work introduces three new gym environments: Mountain Car-RR, Hopper-RR, and Video Pinball-RR, and shows that quantilization outperforms baselines on these tasks.",2019,2022-01-30 4:53:18,2022-01-30 4:53:18,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: 0000000,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BXWIFTJ3/Carey - 2019 - HOW USEFUL IS QUANTILIZATION FOR MITIGATING SPECIF.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/6GSUMWMX/Carey - 2019 - HOW USEFUL IS QUANTILIZATION FOR MITIGATING SPECIF.pdf,,TechSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ICLR 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the size and complexity of these models, safely deploying them in applications requires the development of tools to analyze their behavior rigorously and provide some guarantees that these models are consistent with a list of desirable properties or specifications. For example, a machine translation model should produce semantically equivalent outputs for innocuous changes in the input to the model. A functional regression model that is learning a distribution over monotonic functions should predict a larger value at a larger input. Verification of these properties requires a new framework that goes beyond notions of verification studied in deterministic feedforward networks, since requiring worst-case guarantees in probabilistic models is likely to produce conservative or vacuous results. We propose a novel formulation of verification for deep probabilistic models that take in conditioning inputs and sample latent variables in the course of producing an output: We require that the output of the model satisfies a linear constraint with high probability over the sampling of latent variables and for every choice of conditioning input to the model. We show that rigorous lower bounds on the probability that the constraint is satisfied can be obtained efficiently.

First, introducing attention to the model significantly improves adversarial robustness resulting in state-of-the-art ImageNet accuracies under a wide range of random targeted attack strengths.

T6XFBJ2P,conferencePaper,2016,"Orseau, Laurent; Armstrong, Stuart",Safely Interruptible Agents,,,,,,"Reinforcement learning agents interacting with a complex environment like the real world are unlikely to behave optimally all the time. If such an agent is operating in real-time under human supervision, now and then it may be necessary for a human operator to press the big red button to prevent the agent from continuing a harmful sequence of actions—harmful either for the agent or for the environment—and lead the agent into a safer situation. However, if the learning agent expects to receive rewards from this sequence, it may learn in the long run to avoid such interruptions, for example by disabling the red button—which is an undesirable outcome. This paper explores a way to make sure a learning agent will not learn to prevent (or seek!) being interrupted by the environment or a human operator. We provide a formal deﬁnition of safe interruptibility and exploit the off-policy learning property to prove that either some agents are already safely interruptible, like Q-learning, or can easily be made so, like Sarsa. We show that even ideal, uncomputable reinforcement learning agents for (deterministic) general computable environments can be made safely interruptible.",2016,2022-01-30 4:52:48,2022-01-30 4:52:48,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: 0000098,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/WP7N4XD6/Orseau and Armstrong - Safely Interruptible Agents.pdf,,TechSafety; FHI; DeepMind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most effective strategies to improve robustness is adversarial training. In this paper, we investigate the effect of adversarial training on the geometry of the classification landscape and decision boundaries. We show in particular that adversarial training leads to a significant decrease in the curvature of the loss surface with respect to inputs, leading to a drastically more ""linear"" behaviour of the network. Using a locally quadratic approximation, we provide theoretical evidence on the existence of a strong relation between large robustness and small curvature. To further show the importance of reduced curvature for improving the robustness, we propose a new regularizer that directly minimizes curvature of the loss surface, and leads to adversarial robustness that is on par with adversarial training. Besides being a more efficient and principled alternative to adversarial training, the proposed regularizer confirms our claims on the importance of exhibiting quasi-linear behavior in the vicinity of data points in order to achieve robustness.",2018-11-23,2022-01-30 4:52:48,2022-01-30 4:52:48,2019-12-16 20:33:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s6]  ACC: 161  J: 46 arXiv: 1811.09716,,"/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/JIRVCGMN/Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. - 2018 - Robustness via curvature regularization, and vice .pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/SV67CTM2/1811.html",,TechSafety; DeepMind,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantifying predictive uncertainty in NNs is a challenging and yet unsolved problem. Bayesian NNs, which learn a distribution over weights, are currently the state-of-the-art for estimating predictive uncertainty; however these require significant modifications to the training procedure and are computationally expensive compared to standard (non-Bayesian) NNs. We propose an alternative to Bayesian NNs that is simple to implement, readily parallelizable, requires very little hyperparameter tuning, and yields high quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series of experiments on classification and regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or better than approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to dataset shift, we evaluate the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown distributions, and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty on out-of-distribution examples.

Sensory errors and software bugs may result in RL agents observing higher (or lower) rewards than they should. For example, a reinforcement learning agent may prefer states where a sensory error gives it the maximum reward, but where the true reward is actually small. We formalise this problem as a generalised Markov Decision Problem called Corrupt Reward MDP. Traditional RL methods fare poorly in CRMDPs, even under strong simplifying assumptions and when trying to compensate for the possibly corrupt rewards. Two ways around the problem are investigated. First, by giving the agent richer data, such as in inverse reinforcement learning and semi-supervised reinforcement learning, reward corruption stemming from systematic sensory errors may sometimes be completely managed. Second, by using randomisation to blunt the agent's optimisation, reward corruption can be partially managed under some assumptions.",2017-08-19,2022-01-30 4:52:47,2022-01-30 4:52:47,2019-12-16 20:35:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000066  arXiv: 1705.08417,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/RXAX378F/Everitt et al. - 2017 - Reinforcement Learning with a Corrupted Reward Cha.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/8DU9QAQA/Everitt et al. - 2017 - Reinforcement Learning with a Corrupted Reward Cha.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/74KMWAKW/1705.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/R4CHAQWM/1705.html,,TechSafety; DeepMind,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; I.2.6; I.2.8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IJCAI 2017 AI and Autonomy track,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that current approaches to penalizing side effects can introduce bad incentives, e.g. to prevent any irreversible changes in the environment, including the actions of other agents. To isolate the source of such undesirable incentives, we break down side effects penalties into two components: a baseline state and a measure of deviation from this baseline state. We argue that some of these incentives arise from the choice of baseline, and others arise from the choice of deviation measure. We introduce a new variant of the stepwise inaction baseline and a new deviation measure based on relative reachability of states. The combination of these design choices avoids the given undesirable incentives, while simpler baselines and the unreachability measure fail. We demonstrate this empirically by comparing different combinations of baseline and deviation measure choices on a set of gridworld experiments designed to illustrate possible bad incentives.",2019-03-08,2022-01-30 4:52:47,2022-01-30 4:52:47,2019-12-16 20:35:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s7]  ACC: 27  J: 9 arXiv: 1806.01186,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/TPXKJ9KJ/Krakovna et al. - 2019 - Penalizing side effects using stepwise relative re.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/VKHV6EAF/Krakovna et al. - 2019 - Penalizing side effects using stepwise relative re.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/VWWRAC2Q/1806.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/K4V55HQ6/1806.html,,TechSafety; DeepMind,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Workshop on Artificial Intelligence Safety 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Learning the reward function and optimising for it are typically two different processes, usually performed at different stages. We consider a continual (``one life'') learning approach where the agent both learns the reward function and optimises for it at the same time. We show that this comes with a number of pitfalls, such as deliberately manipulating the learning process in one direction, refusing to learn, ``learning'' facts already known to the agent, and making decisions that are strictly dominated (for all relevant reward functions). We formally introduce two desirable properties: the first is `unriggability', which prevents the agent from steering the learning process in the direction of a reward function that is easier to optimise. The second is `uninfluenceability', whereby the reward-function learning process operates by learning facts about the environment.

We do not know of any general-purpose approaches in the literature to avoiding novel failure modes. Motivated by this, we define an idealized Bayesian reinforcement learner which follows a policy that maximizes the worst-case expected reward over a set of world-models. We call this agent pessimistic, since it optimizes assuming the worst case. A scalar parameter tunes the agent's pessimism by changing the size of the set of world-models taken into account. Our first main contribution is: given an assumption about the agent's model class, a sufficiently pessimistic agent does not cause ""unprecedented events"" with probability $1-\delta$, whether or not designers know how to precisely specify those precedents they are concerned with. Since pessimism discourages exploration, at each timestep, the agent may defer to a mentor, who may be a human or some known-safe policy we would like to improve. Our other main contribution is that the agent's policy's value approaches at least that of the mentor, while the probability of deferring to the mentor goes to 0.

Most of these methods are based on minimizing an upper bound on the worst-case loss over all possible adversarial perturbations. While these techniques show promise, they often result in difﬁcult optimization procedures that remain hard to scale to larger networks. Through a comprehensive analysis, we show how a simple bounding technique, interval bound propagation (IBP), can be exploited to train large provably robust neural networks that beat the state-of-the-art in veriﬁed accuracy. While the upper bound computed by IBP can be quite weak for general networks, we demonstrate that an appropriate loss and clever hyper-parameter schedule allow the network to adapt such that the IBP bound is tight. This results in a fast and stable learning algorithm that outperforms more sophisticated methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN.

In particular, we focus on the doubly robust (DR) estimators that consist of an importance sampling (IS) component and a performance model, and utilize the low (or zero) bias of IS and low variance of the model at the same time. Although the accuracy of the model has a huge impact on the overall performance of DR, most of the work on using the DR estimators in OPE has been focused on improving the IS part, and not much on how to learn the model. In this paper, we propose alternative DR estimators, called more robust doubly robust (MRDR), that learn the model parameter by minimizing the variance of the DR estimator. We first present a formulation for learning the DR model in RL. We then derive formulas for the variance of the DR estimator in both contextual bandits and RL, such that their gradients w.r.t.~the model parameters can be estimated from the samples, and propose methods to efficiently minimize the variance.

While it frames the issue in legal terms of liability and culpability, these terms are deeply imbued and interconnected with their ethical and moral correlate– responsibility. In order for society to benefit from advances in AI technology, it will be necessary to develop regulatory policies which manage the risk and liability of deploying systems with increasingly autonomous capabilities. However, current approaches to liability have difficulties when it comes to dealing with autonomous artificial agents because their behavior may be unpredictable to those who create and deploy them, and they will not be proper legal or moral agents. This problem is the motivation for a research project that will explore the fundamental concepts of autonomy, agency and liability; clarify the different varieties of agency that artificial systems might realize, including causal, legal and moral; and the illuminate the relationships between these. The paper will frame the problem of liability in autonomous agents, sketch out its relation to fundamental concepts in human legal and moral agency– including autonomy, agency, causation, intention, responsibility and culpability–and their applicability or inapplicability to autonomous artificial agents.",2016,2022-01-30 4:53:38,2022-01-30 4:53:38,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: 0000047,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/HB4XG66E/Asaro - The Liability Problem for Autonomous Artificial Ag.pdf,,MetaSafety; AmbiguosSafety; FLI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AAAI Spring Symposia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During training, such systems are potentially dangerous, as they haven't yet learned to avoid actions that could cause serious harm. How can an AI system explore and learn without making a single mistake that harms humans or otherwise causes serious damage? For model-free reinforcement learning, having a human ""in the loop"" and ready to intervene is currently the only way to prevent all catastrophes. We formalize human intervention for RL and show how to reduce the human labor required by training a supervised learner to imitate the human's intervention decisions. We evaluate this scheme on Atari games, with a Deep RL agent being overseen by a human for four hours. When the class of catastrophes is simple, we are able to prevent all catastrophes without affecting the agent's learning (whereas an RL baseline fails due to catastrophic forgetting). However, this scheme is less successful when catastrophes are more complex: it reduces but does not eliminate catastrophes and the supervised learner fails on adversarial examples found by the agent. Extrapolating to more challenging environments, we show that our implementation would not scale (due to the infeasible amount of human labor required).

Publishing scientific research can facilitate misuse of the technology, but the research can also contribute to protections against misuse. This paper addresses the balance between these two effects. Our theoretical framework elucidates the factors governing whether the published research will be more useful for attackers or defenders, such as the possibility for adequate defensive measures, or the independent discovery of the knowledge outside of the scientific community. The balance will vary across scientific fields. However, we show that the existing conversation within AI has imported concepts and conclusions from prior debates within computer security over the disclosure of software vulnerabilities. While disclosure of software vulnerabilities often favours defence, this cannot be assumed for AI research.

Specifically, we examine the intuition that data efficiency will erode the barriers to entry protecting incumbent data-rich AI firms, exposing them to more competition from data-poor firms. We find that this intuition is only partially correct: data efficiency makes it easier to create ML applications, but large AI firms may have more to gain from higher performing AI systems. Further, we find that the effect on privacy, data markets, robustness, and misuse are complex. For example, while it seems intuitive that misuse risk would increase along with data efficiency – as more actors gain access to any level of capability – the net effect crucially depends on how much defensive measures are improved. More investigation into data efficiency, as well as research into the “AI production function"", will be key to understanding the development of the AI industry and its societal impacts.",2020-02-07,2022-01-30 4:53:35,2022-01-30 4:53:35,2020-08-18 21:33:45,378-384,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000006  arXiv: 2001.05068,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9DUUK8Z7/Tucker et al. - 2020 - Social and Governance Implications of Improved Dat.pdf,,MetaSafety; FHI,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computers and Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We draw on the history of other international regimes to identify advantages and disadvantages in centralising AI governance. Some considerations, such as efﬁciency and political power, speak in favour of centralisation. Conversely, the risk of creating a slow and brittle institution speaks against it, as does the difﬁculty in securing participation while creating stringent rules. Other considerations depend on the speciﬁc design of a centralised institution. A well-designed body may be able to deter forum shopping and ensure policy coordination. However, forum shopping can be beneﬁcial and a fragmented landscape of institutions can be self-organising. Centralisation entails trade-offs and the details matter. We conclude with two core recommendations. First, the outcome will depend on the exact design of a central institution. A well-designed centralised regime covering a set of coherent issues could be beneﬁcial. But locking-in an inadequate structure may pose a fate worse than fragmentation. Second, for now fragmentation will likely persist.

Since human planning systematically deviates from rationality, several approaches have been tried to account for speciﬁc human shortcomings. However, the general problem of inferring the reward function of an agent of unknown rationality has received little attention. Unlike the well-known ambiguity problems in IRL, this one is practically relevant but cannot be resolved by observing the agent’s policy in enough environments. This paper shows (1) that a No Free Lunch result implies it is impossible to uniquely decompose a policy into a planning algorithm and reward function, and (2) that even with a reasonable simplicity prior/Occam’s razor on the set of decompositions, we cannot distinguish between the true decomposition and others that lead to high regret.

These difficulties parallel those discussed by Soares et al. (2015) in their paper on corrigibility.

Other researchers are skeptical, because RL agents need not have human-like power-seeking instincts. To clarify this debate, we develop the first formal theory of the statistical tendencies of optimal policies. In the context of Markov decision processes, we prove that certain environmental symmetries are sufficient for optimal policies to tend to seek power over the environment. These symmetries exist in many environments in which the agent can be shut down or destroyed. We prove that in these environments, most reward functions make it optimal to seek power by keeping a range of options available and, when maximizing average reward, by navigating towards larger sets of potential terminal states.",2021-10-23,2022-01-30 4:50:56,2022-01-30 4:50:56,2021-11-14 18:44:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: 1  arXiv: 1912.01683,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/6M65PKWS/Turner et al. - 2021 - Optimal Policies Tend to Seek Power.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/RDF4U9VH/1912.html,,TechSafety,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agents that assume their partner to be optimal or similar to them can converge to coordination protocols that fail to understand and be understood by humans. To demonstrate this, we introduce a simple environment that requires challenging coordination, based on the popular game Overcooked, and learn a simple model that mimics human play. We evaluate the performance of agents trained via self-play and population-based training. These agents perform very well when paired with themselves, but when paired with our human model, they are significantly worse than agents designed to play with the human model. An experiment with a planning algorithm yields the same conclusion, though only when the human-aware planner is given the exact human model that it is playing with. A user study with real humans shows this pattern as well, though less strongly. Qualitatively, we find that the gains come from having the agent adapt to the human's gameplay. Given this result, we suggest several approaches for designing agents that learn about humans in order to better coordinate with them.

Being informative is unfortunately very challenging, because during teaching, people typically get no transparency into what the robot already knows or has learned so far. In contrast, human students naturally provide a wealth of nonverbal feedback that reveals their level of understanding and engagement. In this work, we study how a robot can similarly provide feedback that is minimally disruptive, yet gives human teachers a better mental model of the robot learner, and thus enables them to teach more effectively. Our idea is that at any point, the robot can indicate what it thinks the correct next action is, shedding light on its current estimate of the human's preferences. We analyze how useful this feedback is, both in theory and with two user studies---one with a virtual character that tests the feedback itself, and one with a PR2 robot that uses gaze as the feedback mechanism.

Multitasking problems of this kind are ubiquitous in the real world, yet very little is known about them from a computational viewpoint, beyond the observation that optimal policies for the superprocess may prescribe actions that would be suboptimal for an MDP considered in isolation. (This observation implies that many applications of sequential decision analysis in practice are technically incorrect, since the decision problem being solved is often part of a larger, unstated bandit superprocess.) The paper summarizes the state-of-theart in the theory of bandit superprocesses and contributes a novel upper bound on the global value function of a bandit superprocess, deﬁned in terms of a direct relaxation of the arms. The bound is equivalent to an existing bound (the Whittle integral), but is deﬁned constructively, as the value of a related multi-armed bandit. We provide a new method to compute this bound and derive the ﬁrst practical algorithm to select optimal actions in bandit superprocesses. The algorithm operates by repeatedly establishing dominance relations between actions using upper and lower bounds on action values. Experiments indicate that the algorithm’s run-time compares very favorably to other possible algorithms designed for more general factored MDPs.",2015-07,2022-01-30 4:50:55,2022-01-30 4:50:55,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: 0000002,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/FTI9E6Q8/Hadﬁeld-Menell and Russell - Multitasking Efﬁcient Optimal Planning for Bandit.pdf,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Impossibility theorems in social choice theory and voting theory can be applied to such games, suggesting that strategic behavior by the human principals may complicate the robots task in learning their payoffs. We analyze in particular a bandit apprentice game in which the humans act first to demonstrate their individual preferences for the arms and then the robot acts to maximize the sum of human payoffs.

Recent work has suggested that people have an interest in the robot performing well, and will thus behave pedagogically, choosing actions that are informative to the robot. In turn, robots beneﬁt from interpreting the behavior by accounting for this pedagogy. In this work, we focus on misspeciﬁcation: we argue that robots might not know whether people are being pedagogic or literal and that it is important to ask which assumption is safer to make. We cast objective learning into the more general form of a common-payoff game between the robot and human, and prove that in any such game literal interpretation is more robust to misspeciﬁcation. Experiments with human data support our theoretical results and point to the sensitivity of the pedagogic assumption.",2019-06-28,2022-01-30 4:50:55,2022-01-30 4:50:55,2020-12-20,,,,,,,Literal or Pedagogic Human?,,,,,,,en,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000003[s0]  arXiv: 1903.03877,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/4532ZRGJ/Milli and Dragan - 2019 - Literal or Pedagogic Human Analyzing Human Model .pdf,,CHAI; TechSafety,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The 35th Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence Conference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But human laws and norms are complex and culturally varied systems; in many cases agents will have to learn the rules. This requires autonomous agents to have models of how human rule systems work so that they can make reliable predictions about rules. In this paper we contribute to the building of such models by analyzing an overlooked distinction between important rules and what we call silly rules —rules with no discernible direct impact on welfare. We show that silly rules render a normative system both more robust and more adaptable in response to shocks to perceived stability. They make normativity more legible for humans, and can increase legibility for AI systems as well. For AI systems to integrate into human normative systems, we suggest, it may be important for them to have models that include representations of silly rules.",2019,2022-01-30 4:50:55,2022-01-30 4:50:55,2019-07-08 15:47:44,,,,,,,Legible Normativity for AI Alignment,,,,,,,en,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s6]  ACC: 6  J: 2 arXiv: 1811.01267,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9N9AXA2T/Hadfield-Menell et al. - 2018 - Legible Normativity for AI Alignment The Value of.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/TRSUMM4D/1811.html,,CHAI; TechSafety,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2019 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Real people, on the other hand, often have systematic biases: risk-aversion, myopia, etc. One option is to try to characterize these biases and account for them explicitly during learning. But in the era of deep learning, a natural suggestion researchers make is to avoid mathematical models of human behavior that are fraught with speciﬁc assumptions, and instead use a purely data-driven approach. We decided to put this to the test – rather than relying on assumptions about which speciﬁc bias the demonstrator has when planning, we instead learn the demonstrator’s planning algorithm that they use to generate demonstrations, as a differentiable planner. Our exploration yielded mixed ﬁndings: on the one hand, learning the planner can lead to better reward inference than relying on the wrong assumption; on the other hand, this beneﬁt is dwarfed by the loss we incur by going from an exact to a differentiable planner.

However, such approaches are impeded by the expense of acquiring such feedback. Recent work proposed that agents have access to a source of information that is effectively free: in any environment that humans have acted in, the state will already be optimized for human preferences, and thus an agent can extract information about what humans want from the state (Shah et al., 2019). Such learning is possible in principle, but requires simulating all possible past trajectories that could have led to the observed state. This is feasible in gridworlds, but how do we scale it to complex tasks? In this work, we show that by combining a learned feature encoder with learned inverse models, we can enable agents to simulate human actions backwards in time to infer what they must have done.

We focus speciﬁcally on learning from physical human corrections during the robot’s task execution, where not having a rich enough hypothesis space leads to the robot updating its objective in ways that the person did not actually intend. We observe that such corrections appear irrelevant to the robot, because they are not the best way of achieving any of the candidate objectives.

The user knows the rewards and unsafe states, but querying the user is expensive. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that safely and interactively learns a model of the user's reward function. We start with a generative model of initial states and a forward dynamics model trained on off-policy data. Our method uses these models to synthesize hypothetical behaviors, asks the user to label the behaviors with rewards, and trains a neural network to predict the rewards. The key idea is to actively synthesize the hypothetical behaviors from scratch by maximizing tractable proxies for the value of information, without interacting with the environment. We call this method reward query synthesis via trajectory optimization (ReQueST). We evaluate ReQueST with simulated users on a state-based 2D navigation task and the image-based Car Racing video game. The results show that ReQueST significantly outperforms prior methods in learning reward models that transfer to new environments with different initial state distributions. Moreover, ReQueST safely trains the reward model to detect unsafe states, and corrects reward hacking before deploying the agent.",2019-12-05,2022-01-30 4:50:54,2022-01-30 4:50:54,2020-12-20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000005[s0]  arXiv: 1912.05652,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/RGR6BVZQ/Reddy et al. - 2019 - Learning Human Objectives by Evaluating Hypothetic.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/E85ASZIU/1912.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/QJDICWCK/1912.html,,CHAI; TechSafety; DeepMind,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Computers and Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37th International Conference on Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the person intervenes to correct the robot’s behavior, the robot should update its understanding of which features matter, how much, and in what way. Unfortunately, real users do not provide optimal corrections that isolate exactly what the robot was doing wrong. Thus, when receiving a correction, it is difficult for the robot to determine which features the person meant to correct, and which features were changed unintentionally. In this paper, we propose to improve the efficiency of robot learning during physical interactions by reducing unintended learning. Our approach allows the human-robot team to focus on learning one feature at a time, unlike state-of-the-art techniques that update all features at once. We derive an online method for identifying the single feature which the human is trying to change during physical interaction, and experimentally compare this one-at-a-time approach to the all-at-once baseline in a user study.

Recently, it was found that the maximization of MIAS can be used as an intrinsic motivation for artificial agents. In literature, the term empowerment is used to represent the maximum of MIAS at a certain state. While empowerment has been shown to solve a broad range of reinforcement learning problems, its calculation in arbitrary dynamics is a challenging problem because it relies on the estimation of mutual information. Existing approaches, which rely on sampling, are limited to low dimensional spaces, because high-confidence distribution-free lower bounds for mutual information require exponential number of samples. In this work, we develop a novel approach for the estimation of empowerment in unknown dynamics from visual observation only, without the need to sample for MIAS. The core idea is to represent the relation between action sequences and future states using a stochastic dynamic model in latent space with a specific form. This allows us to efficiently compute empowerment with the ""Water-Filling"" algorithm from information theory.

Inevitably, agents encounter new scenarios (e.g., new types of terrain) where optimizing that same reward may lead to undesired behavior. Our insight is that reward functions are merely observations about what the designer actually wants, and that they should be interpreted in the context in which they were designed. We introduce inverse reward design (IRD) as the problem of inferring the true objective based on the designed reward and the training MDP. We introduce approximate methods for solving IRD problems, and use their solution to plan risk-averse behavior in test MDPs.

While appealing, it can be impractically expensive to collect datasets of demonstrations that cover the variation common in the real world (e.g. opening any type of door). Thus in practice, IRL must commonly be performed with only a limited set of demonstrations where it can be exceedingly difficult to unambiguously recover a reward function.

We ﬁnd that team performance can beat both human and agent performance in isolation. Interestingly, we also ﬁnd that an agent’s performance in isolation does not necessarily correlate with the human-agent team’s performance. A drop in agent performance can lead to a disproportionately large drop in team performance, or in some settings can even improve team performance. Pairing a human with an agent that performs slightly better than them can make them perform much better, while pairing them with an agent that performs the same can make them them perform much worse. Further, our results suggest that people have different exploration strategies and might perform better with agents that match their strategy. Overall, optimizing human-agent team performance requires going beyond optimizing agent performance, to understanding how the agent’s suggestions will inﬂuence human decision-making.",2019,2022-01-30 4:50:53,2022-01-30 4:50:53,2019-07-08 15:46:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s6]  ACC: 2  J: 2 arXiv: 1812.09376,,,,CHAI; TechSafety,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2019 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This mutual dependence, best captured by dynamic game theory, creates a strong coupling between the vehicle’s planning and its predictions of other drivers’ behavior, and constitutes an open problem with direct implications on the safety and viability of autonomous driving technology. Unfortunately, dynamic games are too computationally demanding to meet the real-time constraints of autonomous driving in its continuous state and action space. In this paper, we introduce a novel game-theoretic trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous driving, that enables real-time performance by hierarchically decomposing the underlying dynamic game into a long-horizon “strategic” game with simpliﬁed dynamics and full information structure, and a short-horizon “tactical” game with full dynamics and a simpliﬁed information structure. The value of the strategic game is used to guide the tactical planning, implicitly extending the planning horizon, pushing the local trajectory optimization closer to global solutions, and, most importantly, quantitatively accounting for the autonomous vehicle and the human driver’s ability and incentives to inﬂuence each other. In addition, our approach admits non-deterministic models of human decisionmaking, rather than relying on perfectly rational predictions.

This paper evaluates a human-robot collaboration scheme that combines the task allocation and motion levels of reasoning: the robotic agent uses Bayesian inference to predict the next goal of its human partner from his or her ongoing motion, and re-plans its own actions in real time. This anticipative adaptation is desirable in many practical scenarios, where humans are unable or unwilling to take on the cognitive overhead required to explicitly communicate their intent to the robot.

This results in an evaluation challenge: if we cannot rely on the average training or validation reward as a metric, then how can we effectively evaluate robustness? We take inspiration from the practice of \emph{unit testing} in software engineering. Specifically, we suggest that when designing AI agents that collaborate with humans, designers should search for potential edge cases in \emph{possible partner behavior} and \emph{possible states encountered}, and write tests which check that the behavior of the agent in these edge cases is reasonable. We apply this methodology to build a suite of unit tests for the Overcooked-AI environment, and use this test suite to evaluate three proposals for improving robustness.

A CIRL problem is a cooperative, partial-information game with two agents, human and robot; both are rewarded according to the human's reward function, but the robot does not initially know what this is. In contrast to classical IRL, where the human is assumed to act optimally in isolation, optimal CIRL solutions produce behaviors such as active teaching, active learning, and communicative actions that are more effective in achieving value alignment. We show that computing optimal joint policies in CIRL games can be reduced to solving a POMDP, prove that optimality in isolation is suboptimal in CIRL, and derive an approximate CIRL algorithm.",2016-06-09,2022-01-30 4:50:44,2022-01-30 4:50:44,2020-12-21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arxiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000411,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/C32UQET4/Hadfield-Menell et al. - 2016 - Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/N6SZFWKU/6420-cooperative-inverse-reinforcement-learning.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/X6JQE3BA/1606.html,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NIPS 2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach is intended to provide value for a principal: the user on whose behalf the agent acts. The objectives given to these agents often refer to a partial speciﬁcation of the principal’s goals. We consider the cost of this incompleteness by analyzing a model of a principal and an agent in a resource constrained world where the L attributes of the state correspond to different sources of utility for the principal. We assume that the reward function given to the agent only has support on J < L attributes. The contributions of our paper are as follows: 1) we propose a novel model of an incomplete principal—agent problem from artiﬁcial intelligence; 2) we provide necessary and sufﬁcient conditions under which indeﬁnitely optimizing for any incomplete proxy objective leads to arbitrarily low overall utility; and 3) we show how modifying the setup to allow reward functions that reference the full state or allowing the principal to update the proxy objective over time can lead to higher utility solutions. The results in this paper argue that we should view the design of reward functions as an interactive and dynamic process and identiﬁes a theoretical scenario where some degree of interactivity is desirable.,2021-02-07,2022-01-30 4:50:44,2022-01-30 4:50:44,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000004,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/8A4KHTU8/Zhuang and Hadﬁeld-Menell - Consequences of Misaligned AI.pdf,,CHAI; TechSafety,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NeurIPS 2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, creating a useful distribution of environments is error prone, and takes a significant amount of developer time and effort. We propose Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) as an alternative paradigm, where developers provide environments with unknown parameters, and these parameters are used to automatically produce a distribution over valid, solvable environments. Existing approaches to automatically generating environments suffer from common failure modes: domain randomization cannot generate structure or adapt the difficulty of the environment to the agent's learning progress, and minimax adversarial training leads to worst-case environments that are often unsolvable. To generate structured, solvable environments for our protagonist agent, we introduce a second, antagonist agent that is allied with the environment-generating adversary. The adversary is motivated to generate environments which maximize regret, defined as the difference between the protagonist and antagonist agent's return. We call our technique Protagonist Antagonist Induced Regret Environment Design (PAIRED). Our experiments demonstrate that PAIRED produces a natural curriculum of increasingly complex environments, and PAIRED agents achieve higher zero-shot transfer performance when tested in highly novel environments.",2021-02-03,2022-01-30 4:50:44,2022-01-30 4:50:44,2021-11-13 22:36:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: 21  arXiv: 2012.02096,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/23RGK32W/Dennis et al. - 2021 - Emergent Complexity and Zero-shot Transfer via Uns.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/8C39EB27/2012.html,,TechSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Multiagent Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020),",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A common answer is that they should be adopting their users' driving style. This makes the assumption that users want their autonomous cars to drive like they drive - aggressive drivers want aggressive cars, defensive drivers want defensive cars. In this paper, we put that assumption to the test. We find that users tend to prefer a significantly more defensive driving style than their own. Interestingly, they prefer the style they think is their own, even though their actual driving style tends to be more aggressive.

For the past four decades, human decision-making under uncertainty has continued to be explained by theoretical models based on prospect theory, a framework that was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. However, theoretical models of this kind have developed slowly, and robust, high-precision predictive models of human decisions remain a challenge. While machine learning is a natural candidate for solving these problems, it is currently unclear to what extent it can improve predictions obtained by current theories. We argue that this is mainly due to data scarcity, since noisy human behavior requires massive sample sizes to be accurately captured by off-the-shelf machine learning methods. To solve this problem, what is needed are machine learning models with appropriate inductive biases for capturing human behavior, and larger datasets. We offer two contributions towards this end: first, we construct ""cognitive model priors"" by pretraining neural networks with synthetic data generated by cognitive models (i.e., theoretical models developed by cognitive psychologists). We find that fine-tuning these networks on small datasets of real human decisions results in unprecedented state-of-the-art improvements on two benchmark datasets. Second, we present the first large-scale dataset for human decision-making, containing over 240,000 human judgments across over 13,000 decision problems. This dataset reveals the circumstances where cognitive model priors are useful, and provides a new standard for benchmarking prediction of human decisions under uncertainty.",2019-05-22,2022-01-30 4:50:43,2022-01-30 4:50:43,2019-12-18 2:18:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000047  arXiv: 1905.09397,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/J2ZDVPK2/Bourgin et al. - 2019 - Cognitive Model Priors for Predicting Human Decisi.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/T2SNNBCJ/1905.html,,CHAI; TechSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36th International Conference on Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A promising alternative to manually specifying reward functions is to enable robots to infer them from human feedback, like demonstrations or corrections. To interpret this feedback, robots treat as approximately optimal a choice the person makes from a choice set, like the set of possible trajectories they could have demonstrated or possible corrections they could have made. In this work, we introduce the idea that the choice set itself might be difﬁcult to specify, and analyze choice set misspeciﬁcation: what happens as the robot makes incorrect assumptions about the set of choices from which the human selects their feedback. We propose a classiﬁcation of different kinds of choice set misspeciﬁcation, and show that these different classes lead to meaningful differences in the inferred reward and resulting performance. While we would normally expect misspeciﬁcation to hurt, we ﬁnd that certain kinds of misspeciﬁcation are neither helpful nor harmful (in expectation). However, in other situations, misspeciﬁcation can be extremely harmful, leading the robot to believe the opposite of what it should believe.

Previous work showed that CIRL can be solved as a POMDP, but with an action space size exponential in the size of the reward parameter space. In this work, we exploit a speciﬁc property of CIRL—the human is a full information agent—to derive an optimality-preserving modiﬁcation to the standard Bellman update; this reduces the complexity of the problem by an exponential factor and allows us to relax CIRL’s assumption of human rationality. We apply this update to a variety of POMDP solvers and ﬁnd that it enables us to scale CIRL to non-trivial problems, with larger reward parameter spaces, and larger action spaces for both robot and human.

However, this places on environment designers the onus of designing language-conditional reward functions which may not be easily or tractably implemented as the complexity of the environment and the language scales. To overcome this limitation, we present a framework within which instruction-conditional RL agents are trained using rewards obtained not from the environment, but from reward models which are jointly trained from expert examples. As reward models improve, they learn to accurately reward agents for completing tasks for environment configurations---and for instructions---not present amongst the expert data. This framework effectively separates the representation of what instructions require from how they can be executed. In a simple grid world, it enables an agent to learn a range of commands requiring interaction with blocks and understanding of spatial relations and underspecified abstract arrangements.

This behavior can have severe consequences such as usage of increased computation and induce faults in downstream modules that expect outputs of a certain length.

A plethora of work has demonstrated that it is easy to find or synthesize inputs for which a neural network is highly confident yet wrong.

In this paper we challenge this assumption. We find that the density learned by flow-based models, VAEs, and PixelCNNs cannot distinguish images of common objects such as dogs, trucks, and horses (i.e. CIFAR-10) from those of house numbers (i.e. SVHN), assigning a higher likelihood to the latter when the model is trained on the former. Moreover, we find evidence of this phenomenon when pairing several popular image data sets: FashionMNIST vs MNIST, CelebA vs SVHN, ImageNet vs CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 / SVHN. To investigate this curious behavior, we focus analysis on flow-based generative models in particular since they are trained and evaluated via the exact marginal likelihood. We find such behavior persists even when we restrict the flows to constant-volume transformations. These transformations admit some theoretical analysis, and we show that the difference in likelihoods can be explained by the location and variances of the data and the model curvature. Our results caution against using the density estimates from deep generative models to identify inputs similar to the training distribution until their behavior for out-of-distribution inputs is better understood.",2019-02-24,2022-01-30 4:52:38,2022-01-30 4:52:38,2019-12-16 20:34:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: 333  J: 130 arXiv: 1810.09136,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/DKICH6Q7/Nalisnick et al. - 2019 - Do Deep Generative Models Know What They Don't Kno.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/U8767CAD/1810.html,,TechSafety; DeepMind,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ICLR 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To alleviate the burden on the reward designer, we propose an algorithm to automatically generate an auxiliary reward function that penalizes side effects. This auxiliary objective rewards the ability to complete possible future tasks, which decreases if the agent causes side effects during the current task. The future task reward can also give the agent an incentive to interfere with events in the environment that make future tasks less achievable, such as irreversible actions by other agents. To avoid this interference incentive, we introduce a baseline policy that represents a default course of action (such as doing nothing), and use it to filter out future tasks that are not achievable by default. We formally define interference incentives and show that the future task approach with a baseline policy avoids these incentives in the deterministic case. Using gridworld environments that test for side effects and interference, we show that our method avoids interference and is more effective for avoiding side effects than the common approach of penalizing irreversible actions.",2020-10-15,2022-01-30 4:52:37,2022-01-30 4:52:37,2020-11-14 1:21:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arxiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000008,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/GD35BH4A/Krakovna et al. - 2020 - Avoiding Side Effects By Considering Future Tasks.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/JGBTUMMS/2010.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/ZKJFR6KA/2010.html,,TechSafety; DeepMind; AmbiguosSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In such settings, well calibrated uncertainty estimates convey information about when a model's output should (or should not) be trusted. Many probabilistic deep learning methods, including Bayesian-and non-Bayesian methods, have been proposed in the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty, but to our knowledge there has not previously been a rigorous large-scale empirical comparison of these methods under dataset shift. We present a large-scale benchmark of existing state-of-the-art methods on classification problems and investigate the effect of dataset shift on accuracy and calibration.

In contrast, our framework applies to a general class of activation functions and specifications on neural network inputs and outputs. We formulate verification as an optimization problem (seeking to find the largest violation of the specification) and solve a Lagrangian relaxation of the optimization problem to obtain an upper bound on the worst case violation of the specification being verified. Our approach is anytime i.e. it can be stopped at any time and a valid bound on the maximum violation can be obtained.

However, the computational cost of adversarial training grows prohibitively as the size of the model and number of input dimensions increase. Further, training against less expensive and therefore weaker adversaries produces models that are robust against weak attacks but break down under attacks that are stronger. This is often attributed to the phenomenon of gradient obfuscation; such models have a highly non-linear loss surface in the vicinity of training examples, making it hard for gradient-based attacks to succeed even though adversarial examples still exist. In this work, we introduce a novel regularizer that encourages the loss to behave linearly in the vicinity of the training data, thereby penalizing gradient obfuscation while encouraging robustness. We show via extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, that models trained with our regularizer avoid gradient obfuscation and can be trained significantly faster than adversarial training. Using this regularizer, we exceed current state of the art and achieve 47% adversarial accuracy for ImageNet with l-infinity adversarial perturbations of radius 4/255 under an untargeted, strong, white-box attack.

This suggests that models may optimize this surrogate rather than the true adversarial risk. We formalize this notion as 'obscurity to an adversary,' and develop tools and heuristics for identifying obscured models and designing transparent models. We demonstrate that this is a significant problem in practice by repurposing gradient-free optimization techniques into adversarial attacks, which we use to decrease the accuracy of several recently proposed defenses to near zero.

In this work, we approach the problem from the opposite direction: to formally verify a system's robustness against a predefined class of adversarial attacks. We study text classification under synonym replacements or character flip perturbations. We propose modeling these input perturbations as a simplex and then using Interval Bound Propagation -- a formal model verification method.

In this paper, we ask: are there safe Pareto improvements on this default way of giving instructions? That is, we imagine that the original players can coordinate to tell their representatives to only consider some subset of the available strategies and to assign utilities to outcomes differently than the original players. Then can the original players do this in such a way that the payoff is guaranteed to be weakly higher than under the default instructions for all the original players? In particular, can they Pareto-improve without probabilistic assumptions about how the representatives play games? In this paper, we give some examples of safe Pareto improvements.

Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and the literature contains several related impossibility results.

RBI is designed to take into account the evaluation errors of the Q-function. Such errors are common in RL when learning the $Q$-value from finite past experience data. Greedy policies or even constrained policy optimization algorithms which ignore these errors may suffer from an improvement penalty (i.e. a negative policy improvement). To minimize the improvement penalty, the RBI idea is to attenuate rapid policy changes of low probability actions which were less frequently sampled. This approach is shown to avoid catastrophic performance degradation and reduce regret when learning from a batch of past experience. Through a two-armed bandit with Gaussian distributed rewards example, we show that it also increases data efficiency when the optimal action has a high variance. We evaluate RBI in two tasks in the Atari Learning Environment: (1) learning from observations of multiple behavior policies and (2) iterative RL.

Defenses based on regularization and adversarial training have been proposed, but often followed by new, stronger attacks that defeat these defenses. Can we somehow end this arms race? In this work, we study this problem for neural networks with one hidden layer. We first propose a method based on a semidefinite relaxation that outputs a certificate that for a given network and test input, no attack can force the error to exceed a certain value. Second, as this certificate is differentiable, we jointly optimize it with the network parameters, providing an adaptive regularizer that encourages robustness against all attacks.

To overcome this problem, recent work proposed to augment the specified reward function with an impact regularizer that discourages behavior that has a big impact on the environment. Although initial results with impact regularizers seem promising in mitigating some types of side effects, important challenges remain.

Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst-case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations. The approach is demonstrated on a Deep Q-Network policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios and a classic control task.

Techniques from robust optimal control theory, such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis, allow a rigorous formalization of safety as guaranteed constraint satisfaction. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these tools for general dynamical systems scales poorly with state dimension, making existing tools impractical beyond small problems. Modern reinforcement learning methods have shown promising ability to ﬁnd approximate yet proﬁcient solutions to optimal control problems in complex and high-dimensional systems, however their formulation is restricted to problems with an additive payoff (reward) over time, unsuitable for reasoning about safety. In recent work, we proved that the problem of maximizing the minimum payoff over time, central to safety analysis, can be time-discounted to induce a contraction mapping. Here, we introduce a novel, timediscounted Safety Bellman Equation that renders reinforcement learning techniques amenable to quantitative safety analysis, enabling them to approximate the safe set and optimal safety policy. This opens a new avenue of research connecting controltheoretic safety analysis and the reinforcement learning domain.

Thus, a certain level of freedom to choose the best path to the goal is inherent in making AI robust and flexible enough. At the same time, however, the pervasive deployment of AI in our life, whether AI is autonomous or collaborating with humans, raises several ethical challenges. AI agents should be aware and follow appropriate ethical principles and should thus exhibit properties such as fairness or other virtues. These ethical principles should define the boundaries of AI's freedom and creativity. However, it is still a challenge to understand how to specify and reason with ethical boundaries in AI agents and how to combine them appropriately with subjective preferences and goal specifications. Some initial attempts employ either a data-driven example-based approach for both, or a symbolic rule-based approach for both. We envision a modular approach where any AI technique can be used for any of these essential ingredients in decision making or decision support systems, paired with a contextual approach to define their combination and relative weight. In a world where neither humans nor AI systems work in isolation, but are tightly interconnected, e.g., the Internet of Things, we also envision a compositional approach to building ethically bounded AI, where the ethical properties of each component can be fruitfully exploited to derive those of the overall system.

Although this paradigm uses unlabeled data in a task-agnostic way, in contrast to most previous approaches to semi-supervised learning for computer vision, we show that it is surprisingly effective for semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A key ingredient of our approach is the use of a big (deep and wide) network during pretraining and fine-tuning. We find that, the fewer the labels, the more this approach (task-agnostic use of unlabeled data) benefits from a bigger network. After fine-tuning, the big network can be further improved and distilled into a much smaller one with little loss in classification accuracy by using the unlabeled examples for a second time, but in a task-specific way. The proposed semi-supervised learning algorithm can be summarized in three steps: unsupervised pretraining of a big ResNet model using SimCLRv2 (a modification of SimCLR), supervised fine-tuning on a few labeled examples, and distillation with unlabeled examples for refining and transferring the task-specific knowledge. This procedure achieves 73.9\% ImageNet top-1 accuracy with just 1\% of the labels ($\le$13 labeled images per class) using ResNet-50, a $10\times$ improvement in label efficiency over the previous state-of-the-art.

Unfortunately, many social desiderata concerning consequential decisions, such as justice or fairness, have no natural formulation within a purely predictive framework. In efforts to mitigate these problems, researchers have proposed a variety of metrics for quantifying deviations from various statistical parities that we might expect to observe in a fair world and offered a variety of algorithms in attempts to satisfy subsets of these parities or to trade off the degree to which they are satisfied against utility. In this paper, we connect this approach to \emph{fair machine learning} to the literature on ideal and non-ideal methodological approaches in political philosophy. The ideal approach requires positing the principles according to which a just world would operate. In the most straightforward application of ideal theory, one supports a proposed policy by arguing that it closes a discrepancy between the real and the perfectly just world. However, by failing to account for the mechanisms by which our non-ideal world arose, the responsibilities of various decision-makers, and the impacts of proposed policies, naive applications of ideal thinking can lead to misguided interventions. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between the fair machine learning literature and the ideal approach in political philosophy, and argue that the increasingly apparent shortcomings of proposed fair machine learning algorithms reflect broader troubles faced by the ideal approach.

They will interact with both other learning agents and humans in a variety of complex settings including social dilemmas. We consider the problem of how an external agent can promote cooperation between artificial learners by distributing additional rewards and punishments based on observing the learners' actions. We propose a rule for automatically learning how to create right incentives by considering the players' anticipated parameter updates.

As we continue to create more and more intelligent agents, chances increase that they will learn about this ability. The question is: will they want to use it? For example, highly intelligent systems may find ways to change their goals to something more easily achievable, thereby `escaping' the control of their designers. In an important paper, Omohundro (2008) argued that goal preservation is a fundamental drive of any intelligent system, since a goal is more likely to be achieved if future versions of the agent strive towards the same goal. In this paper, we formalise this argument in general reinforcement learning, and explore situations where it fails. Our conclusion is that the self-modification possibility is harmless if and only if the value function of the agent anticipates the consequences of self-modifications and use the current utility function when evaluating the future.",2016-05-10,2022-01-30 4:56:58,2022-01-30 4:56:58,2020-11-22 4:13:43,,,,,,,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000025  arXiv: 1605.03142,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9EW4V9AK/Everitt et al. - 2016 - Self-Modification of Policy and Utility Function i.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9EXT3XCU/1605.html,,TechSafety; MIRI,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A group's conventions can be viewed as a choice of equilibrium in a coordination game. We consider the problem of an agent learning a policy for a coordination game in a simulated environment and then using this policy when it enters an existing group. When there are multiple possible conventions we show that learning a policy via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is likely to find policies which achieve high payoffs at training time but fail to coordinate with the real group into which the agent enters. We assume access to a small number of samples of behavior from the true convention and show that we can augment the MARL objective to help it find policies consistent with the real group's convention. In three environments from the literature - traffic, communication, and team coordination - we observe that augmenting MARL with a small amount of imitation learning greatly increases the probability that the strategy found by MARL fits well with the existing social convention.

To this end, we exploit regularity assumptions on the dynamics in terms of a Gaussian process prior to construct provably accurate confidence intervals on predicted trajectories. Unlike previous approaches, we do not assume that model uncertainties are independent. Based on these predictions, we guarantee that trajectories satisfy safety constraints.

These mechanisms for defining goals and guiding optimization run into practical and conceptual difficulty when there are independent, multi-dimensional objectives that need to be pursued simultaneously and cannot be reduced to each other. Ethicists have proved several impossibility theorems that stem from this origin; those results appear to show that there is no way of formally specifying what it means for an outcome to be good for a population without violating strong human ethical intuitions (in such cases, the objective function is a social welfare function). We argue that this is a practical problem for any machine learning system (such as medical decision support systems or autonomous weapons) or rigidly rule-based bureaucracy that will make high stakes decisions about human lives: such systems should not use objective functions in the strict mathematical sense. We explore the alternative of using uncertain objectives, represented for instance as partially ordered preferences, or as probability distributions over total orders.

Even if an agent is willing to ascribe a probability to all states and a utility to all outcomes, and maximize expected utility, doing so might present serious computational problems. Moreover, computing the outcome of a given act might be difficult. In a companion paper we develop a framework for game theory with costly computation, where the objects of choice are Turing machines. Here we apply that framework to decision theory. We show how well-known phenomena like first-impression-matters biases (i.e., people tend to put more weight on evidence they hear early on), belief polarization (two people with different prior beliefs, hearing the same evidence, can end up with diametrically opposed conclusions), and the status quo bias (people are much more likely to stick with what they already have) can be easily captured in that framework.

We carry out human subject tests that are the first of their kind to isolate the effect of algorithmic explanations on a key aspect of model interpretability, simulatability, while avoiding important confounding experimental factors. A model is simulatable when a person can predict its behavior on new inputs. Through two kinds of simulation tests involving text and tabular data, we evaluate five explanations methods: (1) LIME, (2) Anchor, (3) Decision Boundary, (4) a Prototype model, and (5) a Composite approach that combines explanations from each method. Clear evidence of method effectiveness is found in very few cases: LIME improves simulatability in tabular classification, and our Prototype method is effective in counterfactual simulation tests. We also collect subjective ratings of explanations, but we do not find that ratings are predictive of how helpful explanations are. Our results provide the first reliable and comprehensive estimates of how explanations influence simulatability across a variety of explanation methods and data domains. We show that (1) we need to be careful about the metrics we use to evaluate explanation methods, and (2) there is significant room for improvement in current methods.

To address this, we present EXPAND (Explanation Augmented Feedback) which allows for explanatory information to be given as saliency maps from the human in addition to the binary feedback. EXPAND employs a state perturbation approach based on the state salient information to augment the feedback, reducing the number of human feedback signals required.

Sometimes, it is desirable for a human operator to \textit{interrupt} an agent in order to prevent dangerous situations from happening. Yet, as part of their learning process, agents may link these interruptions, that impact their reward, to specific states and deliberately avoid them. The situation is particularly challenging in a multi-agent context because agents might not only learn from their own past interruptions, but also from those of other agents. Orseau and Armstrong defined \emph{safe interruptibility} for one learner, but their work does not naturally extend to multi-agent systems. This paper introduces \textit{dynamic safe interruptibility}, an alternative definition more suited to decentralized learning problems, and studies this notion in two learning frameworks: \textit{joint action learners} and \textit{independent learners}. We give realistic sufficient conditions on the learning algorithm to enable dynamic safe interruptibility in the case of joint action learners, yet show that these conditions are not sufficient for independent learners. We show however that if agents can detect interruptions, it is possible to prune the observations to ensure dynamic safe interruptibility even for independent learners.",2017-05-22,2022-01-30 4:59:46,2022-01-30 4:59:46,2020-11-21 17:31:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000022  arXiv: 1704.02882,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/AH67HTNI/Mhamdi et al. - 2017 - Dynamic Safe Interruptibility for Decentralized Mu.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/A66XSDKN/1704.html,,TechSafety; AmbiguosSafety; Other-org,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Multiagent Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NeurIPS 2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper it is argued that extensive decision problems (extensive games with a single player) with imperfect recall suffer from major ambiguities in the interpretation of information sets and strategies. This indeterminacy allows for different kinds of analysis. We address the following issues:    1. Randomization at information sets    2. Consistent beliefs    3. Time consistency of optimal plans    4. The multi-selves approach to decision making    We illustrate our discussion through an example that we call the absentminded driver paradox.    An individual is sitting late at night in a bar planning his midnight trip home. In order to get home he has to take the highway and get off at the second exit. Turning at the first exit leads into a disastrous area (payoff 0). Turning at the second exit yields the highest reward (payoff 4). If he continues beyond the second exit he will reach the end of the highway and find a hotel where he can spend the night (payoff 1). The driver is absentminded and is aware of this fact. When reaching an intersection he cannot tell whether it is the first or the second intersection and he cannot remember how many he has passed. While sitting at the bar, all he can do is to decide whether or not to exit at an intersection (we exclude at this stage the possibility that the decision maker can include random elements in his strategy).    Planning his trip at the bar, the decision maker must conclude that it is impossible for him to get home and he should not exit when he reaches an intersection. Thus, his optimal plan will lead him to spend the night at the hotel and yields a payoff of 1. Now, suppose that he reaches an intersection. Remembering his strategy he concludes that he is at the first intersection with probability 1/2. Then, reviewing his plan, he must conclude that it is optimal for him to leave the highway since it yields an expected payoff of 2. Thus, despite no new information and no change in his preferences, the decision maker is tempted to change his initial plan once he reaches an intersection!    We find this example paradoxical as it exhibits a conflict between two ways of reasoning. The first instructs the decision maker to follow his initial decision not to exit, as this is the optimal rule of behavior. The second leads him to optimize expected payoffs given his beliefs and to deviate from his initial decision.",1996,2022-03-10 22:30:02,2022-03-10 22:30:02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Semantic Scholar,,,,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/On-the-Interpretation-of-Decision-Problems-with-Piccione-Rubinstein/dd03415f643088df006f9ad12e22f43a57adb552?p2df,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is especially critical for planning in complex multi-agent environments, where agents need to anticipate other agents’ intentions and possible future actions. Traditional methods formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process, but the solutions often rely on various assumptions and become brittle when presented with corner cases. In contrast, deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has been very effective at ﬁnding policies by simultaneously exploring, interacting, and learning from environments. Leveraging the powerful Deep RL paradigm, we demonstrate that an iterative procedure of self-play can create progressively more diverse environments, leading to the learning of sophisticated and robust multi-agent policies. We demonstrate this in a challenging multi-agent simulation of merging trafﬁc, where agents must interact and negotiate with others in order to successfully merge on or off the road. While the environment starts off simple, we increase its complexity by iteratively adding an increasingly diverse set of agents to the agent “zoo” as training progresses. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that through selfplay, our policies automatically learn interesting behaviors such as defensive driving, overtaking, yielding, and the use of signal lights to communicate intentions to other agents. In addition, quantitatively, we show a dramatic improvement of the success rate of merging maneuvers from 63% to over 98%.",2020-01-28,2020-08-31 18:42,2020-12-21 18:34,2020-08-31 18:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: 1 arXiv: 2001.10208,,/Users/angelica/Zotero/storage/8SG5VQX4/Tang - 2020 - Towards Learning Multi-agent Negotiations via Self.pdf,,Other-org; NotSafety; AmbiguosSafety,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Robotics; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Multiagent Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While the previous paper introduces other-play to become robust to unknown partners, this paper takes the other approach of simply training an agent that is robust to a wide, diverse population of possible agents.

The types of behavior interpreted as evidence of the reward function have expanded greatly in recent years. We've gone from demonstrations, to comparisons, to reading into the information leaked when the human is pushing the robot away or turning it off. And surely, there is more to come. How will a robot make sense of all these diverse types of behavior? Our key insight is that different types of behavior can be interpreted in a single unifying formalism - as a reward-rational choice that the human is making, often implicitly. The formalism offers both a unifying lens with which to view past work, as well as a recipe for interpreting new sources of information that are yet to be uncovered.

The insight of this paper is that these are all instances of a simple underlying formalism.

Specifically, these forms of preference learning can be described by two properties: (1) the set of choices that the human picks from and (2) how each choice corresponds to a distribution over agent trajectories. Given these properties, we assume that the human makes their choice according to a Boltzmann-rational model (where the human is more likely to choose an option if it leads to higher expected reward). We have now specified a likelihood over the choice given the reward, and we can use Bayes rule to infer a distribution over the reward given the human's choice.

Consider more exotic types of feedback, such as the human's decision to <@turn the agent off@>(@The Off-Switch Game@). Here, the human has two options: turning the agent off (corresponding to the agent staying still forever), or letting it continue (corresponding to the agent taking the trajectory that maximizes its current expected reward). If the agent has the right reward function, then the Boltzmann rational human would let it continue; as a result, if the human instead tries to turn the agent off, Bayes Rule allows the agent to infer that its belief about the reward must be wrong. Thus, even this decision of whether to turn the agent off can be captured in this framework.

The paper then shows two examples of new feedback types that can be generated from this framework: first, credit assignment, in which the human identifies a subset of the trajectory that had maximal reward, and second, meta-choice, where the choice of which _type_ of feedback to give can itself give information about the reward function."

The problem might be simpler to solve if the agent could get a more holistic view of the problem through a structured representation of the reward. This could allow it to infer things like “if I went left, I would get 5 reward, but if I went right, I would get 10 reward”. Under the current RL paradigm, it has to try both actions in separate episodes to learn this.

Model-based RL tries to recover some of this structured representation: it learns a model of the world and the reward function, such that you can ask queries of the form “if I took this sequence of actions, what reward would I get?” The hope is that the learned models will generalize to new sequences that we haven’t previously seen, allowing the agent to learn from fewer environment interactions (i.e. higher sample efficiency).

This work does something similar using _reward machines_. The key idea is to represent both the reward and some aspects of the dynamics using a finite state machine, which can then be reasoned about without collecting more experience. In particular, given a POMDP, they propose learning a set of states U such that when combining the observation o with the state u, we have an MDP instead of a POMDP. This is called a _perfect_ reward machine. To make this feasible, they assume the existence of a labeling function L that, given a transition <o, a, o’>, extracts all of the relevant state information. (Since POMDPs can be reduced to belief-space MDPs, it is always possible to extract a perfect reward machine by having U be the set of possible beliefs and L be the identity function, but the hope is that U and L can be much simpler in most cases.)

They provide a formulation of an optimization problem over finite state machines such that a perfect reward machine would be an optimal solution to that problem (though I believe other imperfect reward machines could also be optimal). Since they are searching over a discrete space, they need to use a discrete optimization algorithm, and end up using Tabu search.

Once they have learned a reward machine from experience and a labeling function L, how can they use it to improve policy learning? They propose a very simple idea: when we get experience <o, a, o’>, treat it as a separate experience for every possible u, so that you effectively multiply the size of your dataset. They can then learn optimal policies that are conditioned on the state u (which can be inferred at test time using the learned state machine). Experiments show that this works in some simple gridworlds."

However, in many realistic settings we only have access to state observations (eg. driving videos). In this setting, we could still infer a reward function and then use reinforcement learning (RL) to imitate the behavior, but this would require a lot of interaction with the environment to learn the dynamics of the environment. Intuitively, even demonstrations with only states and no actions should give us a lot of information about the dynamics -- if we can extract this information, then we would need much less environment interaction during RL. (For example, if you watch a friend play a video game, you only see states, not actions; yet you can infer a lot about the game rules and gameplay.) The key idea is that each action probably causes similar effects on different states. So, they create a model with hidden action nodes z, and use the state observations to learn a policy P(z | s) and dynamics s' = g(s, z) (they assume deterministic dynamics). This is done end-to-end with neural nets, but essentially the net is looking at the sequence of states and figuring out how to assign actions z to each s (this is P(z | s)), such that we can learn a function g(s, z) that outputs the next observed state s'. Once this is trained, intuitively g(s, z) will already have captured most of the dynamics, and so now we only require a small number of environment actions to figure out how the true actions a correspond to the hidden actions z -- concretely, we train a model P(a | s, z). Then, in any state s, we first choose the most likely hidden action z* according to P(z | s), and then the most likely action a* according to P(a | s, z*)."

How might we endow machines with similar capabilities? Here we present an architecture capable of inferring an agent's goals online from both optimal and non-optimal sequences of actions. Our architecture models agents as boundedly-rational planners that interleave search with execution by replanning, thereby accounting for sub-optimal behavior. These models are specified as probabilistic programs, allowing us to represent and perform efficient Bayesian inference over an agent's goals and internal planning processes. To perform such inference, we develop Sequential Inverse Plan Search (SIPS), a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that exploits the online replanning assumption of these models, limiting computation by incrementally extending inferred plans as new actions are observed.

However, this is a pretty bad description of actual human reasoning: it is more accurate to say we are _boundedly-rational planners_. In particular, it makes more sense to assume that our plans are computed from a noisy process. How might we capture this in an algorithm?

This paper models the demonstrator as using a bounded probabilistic [A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to find plans for achieving their goal. The planner is also randomized to account for the difficulty of planning: in particular, when choosing which state to “think about” next, it chooses randomly with higher probability for more promising states (as opposed to vanilla A* which always chooses the most promising state).

The search may fail to find a plan that achieves the goal, in which case the demonstrator follows the actions of the most promising plan found by A* search until no longer possible (either an action leads to a state A* search hadn’t considered, or it reaches the end of its partial plan). Thus, this algorithm can assign significant probability to plans that fail to reach the goal.

The experiments show that this feature allows their SIPS algorithm to infer goals even when the demonstrator fails to reach their goal. For example, if an agent needs to get two keys to unlock two doors to get a blue gem, but only manages to unlock the first door, the algorithm can still infer that the agent’s goal was to obtain the blue gem.

I really like that this paper is engaging with the difficulty of dealing with systematically imperfect demonstrators, and it shows that it can do much better than Bayesian IRL for the domains they consider."

Second, existing methods typically assume homogeneous demonstrations for a single behavior or task, while in practice, it might be easier to collect datasets of heterogeneous but related behaviors. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable model that is capable of learning rewards from demonstrations of distinct but related tasks in an unsupervised way.

Consequently, our discriminator's update solves the generator's optimization problem for free: learning a policy that imitates the expert does not require an additional optimization loop.

MTurk workers are often unable to tell whether the stories were generated by their algorithm or a human!

How does it work? Their architecture has a policy network that creates the stories and a reward network that provides the supervision, which are trained adversarially. We can think of the reward function as inducing a probability distribution over stories, where stories with higher reward are more probable. Then, the reward network acts as a discriminator, trying to make its implied probability distribution similar to the empirical data distribution and dissimilar to the policy network distribution, while the policy network acts as a generator, creating a policy that tries to match the implied probability distribution of the reward network. (This is equivalent to maximizing the expected reward from the reward network.)"

Much work has gone towards preventing the default tendency of machine learning models to catastrophically forget, yet virtually all such work involves manually-designed solutions to the problem. We instead advocate meta-learning a solution to catastrophic forgetting, allowing AI to learn to continually learn. Inspired by neuromodulatory processes in the brain, we propose A Neuromodulated Meta-Learning Algorithm (ANML). It differentiates through a sequential learning process to meta-learn an activation-gating function that enables contextdependent selective activation within a deep neural network. Specifically, a neuromodulatory (NM) neural network gates the forward pass of another (otherwise normal) neural network called the prediction learning network (PLN). The NM network also thus indirectly controls selective plasticity (i.e. the backward pass of) the PLN. ANML enables continual learning without catastrophic forgetting at scale: it produces state-of-the-art continual learning performance, sequentially learning as many as 600 classes (over 9,000 SGD updates).",2020-03-03,2020-08-31 18:00,2020-12-21 17:58,2020-08-31 18:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000012  arXiv: 2002.09571,,/Users/angelica/Zotero/storage/S859IFAF/Beaulieu et al. - 2020 - Learning to Continually Learn.pdf,,Other-org; NotSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ECAI 2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper presents the **ANML** (A Neuromodulated Meta-Learning algorithm) method for countering catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. Continual learning is a problem setting where the system is presented with several tasks in sequence, and must maintain good performance on all of them. When training on new tasks, neural networks often “forget” how to perform the previous tasks, which is called catastrophic forgetting. This makes the naive approach of just training on each task in sequence ineffective.

The paper has two main ideas. First, rather than avoiding catastrophic forgetting by using hand-crafted solutions (e.g. previous methods have encouraged sparsity), the authors use meta-learning to directly optimise for this goal. This is done by **learning a network parameterization which, after training sequentially on many tasks, will get good performance on all tasks**. This outer loop objective can be optimised for directly by taking higher order gradients (gradients of gradients). The second idea is a novel form of neuromodulation. This takes the form of a neuromodulatory (NM) network, which takes the same input as the prediction network, and gates the prediction network’s forward pass. **This provides direct control of the output of the prediction network, but also indirect control of the learning of the prediction network, as gradients will only flow through the paths which haven’t been zeroed out by the gating mechanism.**

**Their method achieves state-of-the-art results on continual learning in Omniglot**, a few-shot dataset consisting of 1623 characters, each with only 20 hand-drawn examples. The network has to learn a sequence of tasks (e.g. classifying a character) with only 15 examples, and is then tested on overall performance over all the classes it’s learned. Their network gets 60% accuracy when presented with 600 classes in a row. **A classifier trained with the same data but shuffled independently at random only gets 68% accuracy**, implying that the catastrophic forgetting of their network only cost 8 percentage points. **Their method also learns a form of sparsity in the activations of the network in a much better way than the hand-crafted methods** - while per-class activations are very sparse, no neurons are wasted, as they all still activate over the entire dataset."

It does this by identifying a small set of most important words in the original sentence, generating candidate synonyms for those words, and gradually replacing the important words in the sentence by testing which synonyms cause the model to mispredict or report the least confidence score.

TextFooler is tested on three state-of-the-art NLP models-- WordCNN, WordLSTM, and BERT, all trained to ~80 - 90% test accuracy. On a variety of text classification datasets, TextFooler reduces accuracy to below ~15% with less than ~20% of the words perturbed. Humans evaluating the generated sentences say they are approximately as grammatical as the original, have the same label as the original in ~90% of cases, and have a sentence similarity score to the original sentence of 0.9 on a 0 to 1 scale. The paper finds that generally, models with higher original accuracy have higher after-attack acuracy.

The authors retrain BERT from scratch using data produced by TextFooler and then attack it using TextFooler again. They find that the after-attack accuracy is higher and that attacks require more perturbed words."

Due to several novel approaches and optimisations in calculating these Shapley values, **the top k most responsible neurons (k ~ 30) can be feasibly found for large networks such as Inception-v3**.

The authors demonstrate that finding these neurons enables the performance of model surgery. Removing the top 30 neurons that contribute to accuracy completely destroys the accuracy, whereas in expectation removing 30 neurons at random from the network barely moves the accuracy at all. Since the method can be applied to an arbitrary metric, this kind of surgery can be performed for other metrics we care about. For example, removing the neurons which are most responsible for vulnerability to adversarial attacks makes the network more robust, and removing the neurons most responsible for the class-accuracy imbalance (a fairness metric) makes the classes much more even, while only reducing the overall accuracy a small amount."

A common model is the Boltzmann noisily-rational decision model, which assumes people approximately optimize a reward function and choose trajectories in proportion to their exponentiated reward. While this model has been successful in a variety of robotics domains, its roots lie in econometrics, and in modeling decisions among different discrete options, each with its own utility or reward. In contrast, human trajectories lie in a continuous space, with continuous-valued features that influence the reward function. We propose that it is time to rethink the Boltzmann model, and design it from the ground up to operate over such trajectory spaces. We introduce a model that explicitly accounts for distances between trajectories, rather than only their rewards. Rather than each trajectory affecting the decision independently, similar trajectories now affect the decision together.

The traditional Boltzmann noisily-rational decision model assumes people approximately optimize a reward function and choose trajectories in proportion to their exponentiated reward. The Boltzmann model works well when modeling decisions among different discrete options, but runs into problems when modeling human trajectories in a continuous space, e.g. path finding, because it is very sensitive to the number of trajectories, even if they are similar-- if a robot using a Boltzmann model must predict whether a human navigates around an obstacle by taking one path on the left or one of three very-similar paths on the right, it will assign the same probability to each path by default.

To fix this, LESS predicts human behavior by treating each trajectory as part of a continuous space and mapping each one to a feature vector. The likelihood of selecting a trajectory is inversely proportional to its feature-space similarity with other trajectories, meaning similar trajectories are appropriately deweighted.

The paper tests the predictive performance of LESS vs. Boltzmann in several experimental environments, including an artifically constructed task where humans are asked to choose between similar paths for navigating around an obstacle, and a real-world task where humans demonstrate appropriate behaviors to a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic arm. In general, LESS performs better than Boltzmann when given a small number of samples of human behavior, but does equally well as the sample size is increased. In the robotic arm task, Boltzmann performed better when demonstrations were aggregated into a single batch and inference was run on the whole batch at once, representing trying to approximate the 'average' user rather than customizing behavior to each user. The paper claims that this happens because Boltzmann overlearns from demonstrations in sparse regions, and underlearns from dense demonstrations. As you increase the number of samples, you approximate the “true” trajectory space better and better, so the 10 trajectory sets vary less and less, which means Boltzmann won’t underperform so much. Since the single batch demonstration aggregated demonstrations, it had a similar effect in approximating the ""true"" trajectory space.

The paper notes that one limitation of this method is a reliance on a pre-specified set of robot features, though a small set of experimental results suggested that LESS still performed better than Boltzmann when adding a small number of irrelevant features."

They want to find a Nash equilibrium in particular. They formalize the Nash equilibrium constraints and use this to motivate a particular optimization problem for multiagent IRL, that looks very similar to their optimization problem for regular IRL in GAIL. After that, it is quite similar to GAIL -- they use a regularizer ψ for the reward functions, show that the composition of multiagent RL and multiagent IRL can be solved as a single optimization problem involving the convex conjugate of ψ, and propose a particular instantiation of ψ that is data-dependent, giving an algorithm. They do have to assume in the theory that the multiagent RL problem has a unique solution, which is not typically true, but may not be too important. As before, to make the algorithm practical, they structure it like a GAN, with discriminators acting like reward functions. What if we have prior information that the game is cooperative or competitive? In this case, they propose changing the regularizer ψ, making it keep all the reward functions the same (if cooperative), making them negations of each other (in two-player zero-sum games), or leaving it as is. They evaluate in a variety of simple multiagent games, as well as a plank environment in which the environment changes between training and test time, thus requiring the agent to learn a robust policy, and find that the correct variant of MAGAIL (cooperative/competitive/neither) outperforms both behavioral cloning and single-agent GAIL (which they run N times to infer a separate reward for each agent)."

In this paper, we propose an approach for removing the need for manual engineering of reward specifications by enabling a robot to learn from a modest number of examples of successful outcomes, followed by actively solicited queries, where the robot shows the user a state and asks for a label to determine whether that state represents successful completion of the task. While requesting labels for every single state would amount to asking the user to manually provide the reward signal, our method requires labels for only a tiny fraction of the states seen during training, making it an efficient and practical approach for learning skills without manually engineered rewards.

They formalize this by creating a model in two steps:

1. A literal or IRL robot is one which learns rewards under the model that the demonstrator is Boltzmann rational.
2. The pedagogic human shows trajectories in proportion to how likely a literal robot would think the true reward is upon seeing the trajectory.

However, designing appropriate shaping rewards is known to be difficult as well as time-consuming. In this work, we address this problem by using natural language instructions to perform reward shaping. We propose the LanguagE-Action Reward Network (LEARN), a framework that maps free-form natural language instructions to intermediate rewards based on actions taken by the agent.

When combined with deep reinforcement learning, T-REX outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning and IRL methods on multiple Atari and MuJoCo benchmark tasks and achieves performance that is often more than twice the performance of the best demonstration.

The key structural innovation of the paper is to learn using pairs of ranked trajectories and learn a neural network-based reward function based on correctly predicting which will be higher. This allows the model to predict what actions will lead to higher and lower reward, and to extrapolate that relationship beyond the best demonstration. When an agent is then trained using this reward model as it's ground truth reward, it's shown to be capable of outperforming the demonstrator on multiple tested environments, including Atari.

Here, the task is framed as: we want to send humans batches of paired trajectories to rank, but which ones? Batch learning is preferable to single-sample active learning because it's more efficient to update a network after a batch of human judgments, rather than after each single one. This adds complexity to the problem because you'd prefer to not have a batch of samples that are individually high-expected-information, but which are redundant with one another. The authors define an information criterion (basically the examples about which we're most uncertain of the human's judgment) and then pick a batch of examples based on different heuristics for getting a set of trajectories with high information content that are separated from each other in feature space."

When the agent doesn't have a good model of what actions cause what state changes, it may mismodel the effects of a state change as a cause-- e.g., an agent learning to drive a car may incorrectly learn that it should turn on the brakes whenever the brake light on the dashboard is on. This leads to undesirable behavior where more information actually causes the agent to perform worse.

The paper presents an approach for resolving causal misidentification by (1) Training a specialized network to generate a ""disentangled"" representation of the state as variables, (2) Representing causal relationships between those variables in a graph structure, (3) Learning policies corresponding to each possible causal graph, and (4) Performing targeted interventions, either by querying an expert, or by executing a policy and observing the reward, to find the correct causal graph model.

The paper experiments with this method by testing it in environments artificially constructed to have confounding variables that correlate with actions but do not cause them. It finds that this method is successfully able to improve performance with confounding variables, and that it performs significantly better per number of queries (to an expert or of executing a policy) than any existing methods. It also finds that directly executing a policy and observing the reward is a more efficient strategy for narrowing down the correct causal graph than querying an expert."

We propose a geometric framework, drawing on tools from the manifold reconstruction literature, to analyze the high-dimensional geometry of adversarial examples. In particular, we highlight the importance of codimension: for low-dimensional data manifolds embedded in high-dimensional space there are many directions off the manifold in which to construct adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are a natural consequence of learning a decision boundary that classiﬁes the low-dimensional data manifold well, but classiﬁes points near the manifold incorrectly. Using our geometric framework we prove (1) a tradeoff between robustness under different norms, (2) that adversarial training in balls around the data is sample inefﬁcient, and (3) sufﬁcient sampling conditions under which nearest neighbor classiﬁers and ball-based adversarial training are robust.",2019,2019-12-18 2:24,2020-12-26 23:16,2019-12-18 2:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000015  arXiv: 1811.00525,,/Users/angelica/Zotero/storage/FJUZGQWD/Khoury and Hadfield-Menell - 2018 - On the Geometry of Adversarial Examples.pdf,,NotSafety; CHAI-Berkeley; AmbiguosSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper analyzes adversarial examples based off a key idea: even if the data of interest forms a low-dimensional manifold, as we often assume, the ϵ-tube _around_ the manifold is still high-dimensional, and so accuracy in an ϵ-ball around true data points will be hard to learn.

For a given L_p norm, we can define the optimal decision boundary to be the one that maximizes the margin from the true data manifold. If there exists some classifier that is adversarially robust, then the optimal decision boundary is as well. Their first result is that the optimal decision boundary can change dramatically if you change p. In particular, for concentric spheres, the optimal L_inf decision boundary provides an L_2 robustness guarantee √d times smaller than the optimal L_2 decision boundary, where d is the dimensionality of the input. This explains why a classifier that is adversarially trained on L_inf adversarial examples does so poorly on L_2 adversarial examples.

I'm not sure I understand the point of the next section, but I'll give it a try. They show that a nearest neighbors classifier can achieve perfect robustness if the underlying manifold is sampled sufficiently densely (requiring samples exponential in k, the dimensionality of the manifold). However, a learning algorithm with a particular property that they formalize would require exponentially more samples in at least some cases in order to have the same guarantee. I don't know why they chose the particular property they did -- my best guess is that the property is meant to represent what we get when we train a neural net on L_p adversarial examples. If so, then their theorem suggests that we would need exponentially more training points to achieve perfect robustness with adversarial training compared to a nearest neighbor classifier.

They next turn to the fact that the ϵ-tube around the manifold is d-dimensional instead of k-dimensional. If we consider ϵ-balls around the training set X, this covers a very small fraction of the ϵ-tube, approaching 0 as d becomes much larger than k, even if the training set X covers the k-dimensional manifold sufficiently well.

Another issue is that if we require adversarial robustness, then we severely restrict the number of possible decision boundaries, and so we may need significantly more expressive models to get one of these decision boundaries. In particular, since feedforward neural nets with Relu activations have ""piecewise linear"" decision boundaries (in quotes because I might be using the term incorrectly), it is hard for them to separate concentric spheres. Suppose that the spheres are separated by a distance d. Then for accuracy on the manifold, we only need the decision boundary to lie entirely in the shell of width d. However, for ϵ-tube adversarial robustness, the decision boundary must lie in a shell of width d - 2ϵ. They prove a lower bound on the number of linear regions for the decision boundary that grows as τ^(-d), where τ is the width of the shell, suggesting that adversarial robustness would require more parameters in the model.

Their experiments show that for simple learning problems (spheres and planes), adversarial examples tend to be in directions orthogonal to the manifold. In addition, if the true manifold has high codimension, then the learned model has poor robustness."

IL can be useful to kick-start learning before applying reinforcement learning (RL) but it can also be useful on its own, e.g. to learn to imitate human players in video games. However, a major limitation of current IL approaches is that they learn only a single ""average"" policy based on a dataset that possibly contains demonstrations of numerous different types of behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Behavioral Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) that instead learns a repertoire of behaviors from a set of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs with behavioral descriptions. The outcome of this approach is a single neural network policy conditioned on a behavior description that can be precisely modulated. We apply this approach to train a policy on 7,777 human replays to perform build-order planning in StarCraft II. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to construct a low-dimensional behavioral space from the high-dimensional army unit composition of each demonstration. The results demonstrate that the learned policy can be effectively manipulated to express distinct behaviors. Additionally, by applying the UCB1 algorithm, we are able to adapt the behavior of the policy - in-between games - to reach a performance beyond that of the traditional IL baseline approach.",2019-07-05,2020-11-14 0:52,2020-12-19 15:26,2020-11-14 0:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  ACC: 3  arXiv: 1907.03046,,/Users/angelica/Zotero/storage/ZGWIDIBS/1907.html; /Users/angelica/Zotero/storage/NVEKA7C3/Justesen et al. - 2019 - Learning a Behavioral Repertoire from Demonstratio.pdf,,Other-org; NotSafety,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"They extend vanilla Imitation Learning, adding a behaviour encoding as an input to the policy to prevent it from learning an 'average' behaviour, but instead to learn different strategies with a single policy.

These contrastive methods typically work online and rely on a large number of explicit pairwise feature comparisons, which is computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm, SwAV, that takes advantage of contrastive methods without requiring to compute pairwise comparisons. Specifically, our method simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or “views”) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly as in contrastive learning. Simply put, we use a “swapped” prediction mechanism where we predict the cluster assignment of a view from the representation of another view. Our method can be trained with large and small batches and can scale to unlimited amounts of data. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method is more memory efﬁcient since it does not require a large memory bank or a special momentum network. In addition, we also propose a new data augmentation strategy, multi-crop, that uses a mix of views with different resolutions in place of two full-resolution views, without increasing the memory or compute requirements much.

However, a major challenge in training agents from learned reward models is that the agent can learn to exploit errors in the reward model to achieve high reward behaviors that do not correspond to the intended task. These reward delusions can lead to unintended and even dangerous behaviors. On the other hand, adversarial imitation learning frameworks tend to suffer the opposite problem, where the discriminator learns to trivially distinguish agent and expert behavior, resulting in reward models that produce low reward signal regardless of the input state. In this paper, we connect these two classes of reward learning methods to positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, and we show that by applying a large-scale PU learning algorithm to the reward learning problem, we can address both the reward under- and over-estimation problems simultaneously.

However, this effectively treats the agent trajectories as negative examples — even once the agent has mastered the task. What we would really like to do is to treat the agent trajectories as unlabeled data. This is an instance of _semi-supervised learning_, in which a classifier has access to a small set of labeled data and a much larger collection of unlabeled data. In general, the common approach is to propagate classification information learned using labels to the unlabeled dataset. The authors apply a recent algorithm for positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, and show that this approach can improve upon both GAIL and supervised reward learning."

This function is known as the von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function. The theorem is the basis for expected utility theory. In 1947, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern proved that any individual whose preferences satisfied four axioms has a utility function; such an individual's preferences can be represented on an interval scale and the individual will always prefer actions that maximize expected utility. That is, they proved that an agent is (VNM-)rational if and only if there exists a real-valued function u defined by possible outcomes such that every preference of the agent is characterized by maximizing the expected value of u, which can then be defined as the agent's VNM-utility (it is unique up to adding a constant and multiplying by a positive scalar). No claim is made that the agent has a ""conscious desire"" to maximize u, only that u exists. The expected utility hypothesis is that rationality can be modeled as maximizing an expected value, which given the theorem, can be summarized as ""rationality is VNM-rationality"". However, the axioms themselves have been critiqued on various grounds, resulting in the axioms being given further justification.VNM-utility is a decision utility in that it is used to describe decision preferences. It is related but not equivalent to so-called E-utilities (experience utilities), notions of utility intended to measure happiness such as that of Bentham's Greatest Happiness Principle.",2021-09-15,2022-03-10 22:16:04,2022-03-10 22:16:04,2022-03-10 22:16:04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License,,,,Wikipedia,,Page Version ID: 1044421624,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We draw on the history of environment, trade, and security regimes to identify advantages and disadvantages in centralising AI governance. Some considerations, such as efficiency and political power, speak for centralisation. The risk of creating a slow and brittle institution, and the difficulty of pairing deep rules with adequate participation, speak against it. Other considerations depend on the specific design. A centralised body may be able to deter forum shopping and ensure policy coordination. However, forum shopping can be beneficial, and fragmented institutions could self-organise. In sum, these trade-offs should inform development of the AI governance architecture, which is only now emerging. We apply the trade-offs to the case of the potential development of high-level machine intelligence. We conclude with two recommendations. First, the outcome will depend on the exact design of a central institution. A well-designed centralised regime covering a set of coherent issues could be beneficial. But locking-in an inadequate structure may pose a fate worse than fragmentation. Second, fragmentation will likely persist for now.

This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the activity of many neurons covaries with subjective value as estimated in specific tasks and has led to the idea that the primary function of the orbitofrontal cortex is to compute and signal economic value. Here we consider an alternative: that economic value, in the cardinal, common-currency sense, is not represented in the brain and used for choice by default. This idea is motivated by consideration of the economic concept of value, which places important epistemic constraints on our ability to identify its neural basis. It is also motivated by the behavioral economics literature, especially work on heuristics, which proposes value-free process models for much if not all of choice. Finally, it is buoyed by recent neural and behavioral findings regarding how animals and humans learn to choose between options. In light of our hypothesis, we critically reevaluate putative neural evidence for the representation of value and explore an alternative: direct learning of action policies. We delineate how this alternative can provide a robust account of behavior that concords with existing empirical data.",2021,2022-01-30 4:48:47,2022-01-30 4:48:47,2021-11-08 23:41:47,192-201,,2,135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: 0000026  DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/7hgup,,,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these systems may also enclose potential conflicts and unintended consequences. Notably, people will tend to adopt an A.I. system if it confers them an advantage, at which point non-adopters might push for a strong regulation if that advantage for adopters is at a cost for them. Here we propose an agent-based game-theoretical model for these conflicts, where agents may decide to resort to A.I. to use and acquire additional information on the payoffs of a stochastic game, striving to bring insights from simulation to what has been, hitherto, a mostly philosophical discussion. We frame our results under the current discussion on ethical A.I. and the conflict between individual and societal gains: the societal value alignment problem. We test the arising equilibria in the adoption of A.I. technology under different norms followed by artificial agents, their ensuing benefits, and the emergent levels of wealth inequality. We show that without any regulation, purely selfish A.I. systems will have the strongest advantage, even when a utilitarian A.I. provides significant benefits for the individual and the society. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to develop A.I. systems following human conscious policies that, when introduced in society, lead to an equilibrium where the gains for the adopters are not at a cost for non-adopters, thus increasing the overall wealth of the population and lowering inequality.

HDWGJGAP,journalArticle,2021,"Mingard, Chris; Valle-Pérez, Guillermo; Skalse, Joar; Louis, Ard A.","Is SGD a Bayesian sampler? Well, almost",Journal of Machine Learning Research,,,,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15191,"Overparameterised deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly expressive and so can, in principle, generate almost any function that fits a training dataset with zero error. The vast majority of these functions will perform poorly on unseen data, and yet in practice DNNs often generalise remarkably well. This success suggests that a trained DNN must have a strong inductive bias towards functions with low generalisation error. Here we empirically investigate this inductive bias by calculating, for a range of architectures and datasets, the probability $P_{SGD}(f\mid S)$ that an overparameterised DNN, trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or one of its variants, converges on a function $f$ consistent with a training set $S$. We also use Gaussian processes to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability $P_B(f\mid S)$ that the DNN expresses $f$ upon random sampling of its parameters, conditioned on $S$. Our main findings are that $P_{SGD}(f\mid S)$ correlates remarkably well with $P_B(f\mid S)$ and that $P_B(f\mid S)$ is strongly biased towards low-error and low complexity functions. These results imply that strong inductive bias in the parameter-function map (which determines $P_B(f\mid S)$), rather than a special property of SGD, is the primary explanation for why DNNs generalise so well in the overparameterised regime. While our results suggest that the Bayesian posterior $P_B(f\mid S)$ is the first order determinant of $P_{SGD}(f\mid S)$, there remain second order differences that are sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. A function probability picture, based on $P_{SGD}(f\mid S)$ and/or $P_B(f\mid S)$, can shed new light on the way that variations in architecture or hyperparameter settings such as batch size, learning rate, and optimiser choice, affect DNN performance.",2021-02,2022-01-30 4:48:46,2022-03-11 1:39:08,2021-11-13 22:56:31,,,,22,,,Is SGD a Bayesian sampler?,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000009  arXiv: 2006.15191,,"/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/ACV9IXEG/Mingard et al. - 2020 - Is SGD a Bayesian sampler Well, almost.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BC3NUUZG/Mingard et al. - 2020 - Is SGD a Bayesian sampler Well, almost.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/EN2JTJZ8/2006.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/VEJMZHMR/2006.html",,UnsortedSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We illustrate the potential power of this new paradigm by reviewing models of common sense that synthesize recent breakthroughs in both machine and human vision. We identify functionality, physics, intent, causality, and utility (FPICU) as the five core domains of cognitive AI with humanlike common sense. When taken as a unified concept, FPICU is concerned with the questions of ""why"" and ""how"", beyond the dominant ""what"" and ""where"" framework for understanding vision. They are invisible in terms of pixels but nevertheless drive the creation, maintenance, and development of visual scenes. We therefore coin them the ""dark matter"" of vision. Just as our universe cannot be understood by merely studying observable matter, we argue that vision cannot be understood without studying FPICU. We demonstrate the power of this perspective to develop cognitive AI systems with humanlike common sense by showing how to observe and apply FPICU with little training data to solve a wide range of challenging tasks, including tool use, planning, utility inference, and social learning.

Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations.

The AI ‘value alignment problem’ faces two kinds of challenges—a technical and a normative one—which are interrelated. The technical challenge deals with the question of how to encode human values in artificial intelligence. The normative challenge is associated with two questions: “Which values or whose values should artificial intelligence align with?” My concern is that AI developers underestimate the difficulty of answering the normative question. They hope that we can easily identify the purposes we really desire and that they can focus on the design of those objectives. But how are we to decide which objectives or values to induce in AI, given that there is a plurality of values and moral principles and that our everyday life is full of moral disagreements? In my paper I will show that although it is not realistic to reach an agreement on what we, humans, really want as people value different things and seek different ends, it may be possible to agree on what we do not want to happen, considering the possibility that intelligence, equal to our own, or even exceeding it, can be created.

One obstacle to overcome is the amount of data needed by learning systems of this type. In this article, we propose to address this issue through a divide-and-conquer approach. We argue that complex decision problems can be naturally decomposed into multiple tasks that unfold in sequence or in parallel. By associating each task with a reward function, this problem decomposition can be seamlessly accommodated within the standard reinforcement-learning formalism. The specific way we do so is through a generalization of two fundamental operations in reinforcement learning: policy improvement and policy evaluation. The generalized version of these operations allow one to leverage the solution of some tasks to speed up the solution of others. If the reward function of a task can be well approximated as a linear combination of the reward functions of tasks previously solved, we can reduce a reinforcement-learning problem to a simpler linear regression. When this is not the case, the agent can still exploit the task solutions by using them to interact with and learn about the environment. Both strategies considerably reduce the amount of data needed to solve a reinforcement-learning problem.",2020-12-01,2022-01-30 4:47:57,2022-01-30 4:47:57,2021-11-13 13:59:52,30079-30087,,48,117,,Proc Natl Acad Sci USA,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: 0000026,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/WGDHG555/Barreto et al. - 2020 - Fast reinforcement learning with generalized polic.pdf,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We argue, as others have   done, that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes   fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a result, there has   arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI, hindering   progress in the field. We propose instead a property called  bounded   optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its   program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem   presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to   construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine   architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We   illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail   sorting facility.  We also define a weaker property,  asymptotic   bounded optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in   classical complexity theory.  We then construct  universal  ABO   programs, i.e., programs that are ABO no matter what real-time   constraints are applied.  Universal ABO programs can be used as   building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude with a   discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical   basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy,   economics, and game theory.",1995-05-01,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2020-11-22 2:23:36,575-609,,,2,,jair,,,,,,,,,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s2]  ACC: 437,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/E5SU8UNI/Russell and Subramanian - 1995 - Provably Bounded-Optimal Agents.pdf,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They predict their future trajectories and plan to stay out of their way. While physically safe, this results in defensive and opaque behaviors. In reality, an autonomous car’s actions will actually affect what other cars will do in response, creating an opportunity for coordination. Our thesis is that we can leverage these responses to plan more efﬁcient and communicative behaviors. We introduce a formulation of interaction with human-driven vehicles as an underactuated dynamical system, in which the robot’s actions have consequences on the state of the autonomous car, but also on the human actions and thus the state of the human-driven car. We model these consequences by approximating the human’s actions as (noisily) optimal with respect to some utility function. The robot uses the human actions as observations of her underlying utility function parameters. We ﬁrst explore learning these parameters ofﬂine, and show that a robot planning in the resulting underactuated system is more efﬁcient than when treating the person as a moving obstacle. We also show that the robot can target speciﬁc desired effects, like getting the person to switch lanes or to proceed ﬁrst through an intersection. We then explore estimating these parameters online, and enable the robot to perform active information gathering: generating actions that purposefully probe the human in order to clarify their underlying utility parameters, like driving style or attention level. We show that this signiﬁcantly outperforms passive estimation and improves efﬁciency. Planning in our model results in coordination behaviors: the robot inches forward at an intersection to see if can go through, or it reverses to make the other car proceed ﬁrst. These behaviors result from the optimization, without relying on hand-coded signaling strategies. Our user studies support the utility of our model when interacting with real users.",2018-10,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2022-01-30 4:51:07,2019-12-18 2:39:40,1405-1426,,7,42,,Auton Robot,Planning for cars that coordinate with people,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: 0000086,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/IZXDWBKE/Sadigh et al. - 2018 - Planning for cars that coordinate with people lev.pdf,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A market is then called a logical inductor if (very roughly) there is no polynomial-time computable trading strategy with finite risk tolerance that earns unbounded profits in that market over time.

We then offer three interpretations of the Whiteness of AI, drawing on critical race theory, particularly the idea of the White racial frame. First, we examine the extent to which this Whiteness might simply reflect the predominantly White milieus from which these artefacts arise. Second, we argue that to imagine machines that are intelligent, professional, or powerful is to imagine White machines because the White racial frame ascribes these attributes predominantly to White people. Third, we argue that AI racialised as White allows for a full erasure of people of colour from the White utopian imaginary.

DRL is one of the most promising routes towards developing more autonomous AI systems that interact with and take actions in complex real-world environments, and can more flexibly solve a range of problems for which we may not be able to precisely specify a correct ‘answer’.

Accordingly, an appropriate policy approach is urgently needed. While there has been a wave of scholarship in this field, the research community at times appears divided amongst those who emphasize ‘near-term’ concerns and those focusing on ‘long-term’ concerns and corresponding policy measures. In this paper, we seek to examine this alleged ‘gap’, with a view to understanding the practical space for inter-community collaboration on AI policy. We propose to make use of the principle of an ‘incompletely theorized agreement’ to bridge some underlying disagreements, in the name of important cooperation on addressing AI’s urgent challenges. We propose that on certain issue areas, scholars working with near-term and long-term perspectives can converge and cooperate on selected mutually beneficial AI policy projects, while maintaining their distinct perspectives.",2021-08-01,2022-01-30 4:50:25,2022-01-30 4:50:25,2021-10-31 17:04:06,261-271,,3,1,,AI Ethics,Bridging the gap,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,ZSCC: 0000008,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/F7AQ9SK8/Stix and Maas - 2021 - Bridging the gap the case for an ‘Incompletely Th.pdf,,MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet something has begun to change in change. In the face of a range of emerging, complex, and interconnected global challenges, society’s collective governance efforts may need to be put on a different footing. Many of these challenges derive from emerging technological developments – take Artificial Intelligence (AI), the focus of much contemporary governance scholarship and efforts. AI governance strategies have predominantly oriented themselves towards clear, discrete clusters of pre-defined problems. We argue that such ‘problem-solving’ approaches may be necessary, but are also insufficient in the face of many of the ‘wicked problems’ created or driven by AI. Accordingly, we propose in this paper a complementary framework for grounding long-term governance strategies for complex emerging issues such as AI into a ‘problem-finding’ orientation. We first provide a rationale by sketching the range of policy problems created by AI, and providing five reasons why problem-solving governance approaches to these challenges fail or fall short. We conversely argue that that creative, ‘problem-finding’ research into these governance challenges is not only warranted scientifically, but will also be critical in the formulation of governance strategies that are effective, meaningful, and resilient over the long-term. We accordingly illustrate the relation between and the complementarity of problem-solving and problem-finding research, by articulating a framework that distinguishes between four distinct ‘levels’ of governance: problem-solving research generally approaches AI (governance) issues from a perspective of (Level 0) ‘business-as-usual’ or as (Level 1) ‘governance puzzle-solving’. In contrast, problem-finding approaches emphasize (Level 2) ‘governance Disruptor-Finding’; or (Level 3) ‘Charting Macrostrategic Trajectories’. We apply this theoretical framework to contemporary governance debates around AI throughout our analysis to elaborate upon and to better illustrate our framework. We conclude with reflections on nuances, implications, and shortcomings of this long-term governance framework, offering a range of observations on intra-level failure modes, between-level complementarities, within-level path dependencies, and the categorical boundary conditions of governability (‘Governance Goldilocks Zone’). We suggest that this framework can help underpin more holistic approaches for long-term strategy-making across diverse policy domains and contexts, and help cross the bridge between concrete policies on local solutions, and longer-term considerations of path-dependent societal trajectories to avert, or joint visions towards which global communities can or should be rallied.",2021-02-01,2022-01-30 4:50:25,2022-01-30 4:50:25,2021-10-31 17:02:28,102672,,,126,,Futures,‘Solving for X?,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,ZSCC: 0000005,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/R74GTS83/S0016328720301634.html,,MetaSafety,Artificial intelligence; Governance disruptors; Governance goldilocks zone; Governance puzzles; Macrostrategic trajectories & destinations; Problem-finding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the difﬁculty in moving from principles to practice presents a signiﬁcant challenge to the implementation of ethical guidelines. Herein, we describe two complementary frameworks for integrating ethical analysis into engineering practice to help address this challenge.

There are many barriers to achieving this at present, including mistrust between cultures, and more practical challenges of coordinating across different locations. This paper focuses particularly on barriers to cooperation between Europe and North America on the one hand and East Asia on the other, as regions which currently have an outsized impact on the development of AI ethics and governance. We suggest that there is reason to be optimistic about achieving greater cross-cultural cooperation on AI ethics and governance. We argue that misunderstandings between cultures and regions play a more important role in undermining cross-cultural trust, relative to fundamental disagreements, than is often supposed. Even where fundamental differences exist, these may not necessarily prevent productive cross-cultural cooperation, for two reasons: (1) cooperation does not require achieving agreement on principles and standards for all areas of AI; and (2) it is sometimes possible to reach agreement on practical issues despite disagreement on more abstract values or principles. We believe that academia has a key role to play in promoting cross-cultural cooperation on AI ethics and governance, by building greater mutual understanding, and clarifying where different forms of agreement will be both necessary and possible. We make a number of recommendations for practical steps and initiatives, including translation and multilingual publication of key documents, researcher exchange programmes, and development of research agendas on cross-cultural topics.",2020-05-15,2022-01-30 4:50:25,2022-01-30 4:50:25,2020-08-21 19:45:24,,,,,,Philos.

We call it “the control problem”, understood as the tendency of the human within a human–machine control loop to become complacent, over-reliant or unduly diffident when faced with the outputs of a reliable autonomous system. While the control problem has been investigated for some time, up to this point its manifestation in machine learning contexts has not received serious attention. This paper aims to fill that gap. We argue that, except in certain special circumstances, algorithmic decision tools should not be used in high-stakes or safety-critical decisions unless the systems concerned are significantly “better than human” in the relevant domain or subdomain of decision-making. More concretely, we recommend three strategies to address the control problem, the most promising of which involves a               complementary               (and potentially               dynamic               ) coupling between highly proficient algorithmic tools and human agents working alongside one another.

In this article, I argue that only the sort of transparency that arises from critique—a method of theoretical examination that, by revealing pre-existing power structures, aims to challenge them—can help us produce technological systems that are less deceptive and more just.

Using three samples (UK general public, US general public, and UK students; total N = 2,507), we study how laypeople reason about human extinction. We find that people think that human extinction needs to be prevented. Strikingly, however, they do not think that an extinction catastrophe would be uniquely bad relative to near-extinction catastrophes, which allow for recovery. More people find extinction uniquely bad when (a) asked to consider the extinction of an animal species rather than humans, (b) asked to consider a case where human extinction is associated with less direct harm, and (c) they are explicitly prompted to consider long-term consequences of the catastrophes. We conclude that an important reason why people do not find extinction uniquely bad is that they focus on the immediate death and suffering that the catastrophes cause for fellow humans, rather than on the long-term consequences.

These multi-agent failure modes are more complex, more problematic, and less well understood than the single-agent case, and are also already occurring, largely unnoticed. After motivating the discussion with examples from poker-playing artificial intelligence (AI), the paper explains why these failure modes are in some senses unavoidable. Following this, the paper categorizes failure modes, provides definitions, and cites examples for each of the modes: accidental steering, coordination failures, adversarial misalignment, input spoofing and filtering, and goal co-option or direct hacking.

We find that ranked preference modeling performs much better than imitation learning, and often scales more favorably with model size.

This paper presents arguments for a (narrower) version of the thesis. It proceeds through three steps. First it shows that superintelligent agents with essentially arbitrary goals can exist in our universe –both as theoretical impractical agents such as AIXI and as physically possible realworld agents. Then it argues that if humans are capable of building human-level artificial intelligences, we can build them with an extremely broad spectrum of goals. Finally it shows that the same result holds for any superintelligent agent we could directly or indirectly build. This result is relevant for arguments about the potential motivations of future agents: knowing an artificial agent is of high intelligence does not allow us to presume that it will be moral, we will need to figure out its goals directly.",2013,2022-01-30 4:53:10,2022-01-30 4:53:10,2020-12-18,17,,12,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: 0000032,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/QXXGIDCH/Armstrong - 2020 - GENERAL PURPOSE INTELLIGENCE ARGUING THE ORTHOGON.pdf,,TechSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many theories of value imply that even relatively small reductions in net existential risk have enormous expected value. Despite their importance, issues surrounding human-extinction risks and related hazards remain poorly understood. In this article, I clarify the concept of existential risk and develop an improved classification scheme. I discuss the relation between existential risks and basic issues in axiology, and show how existential risk reduction (via the maxipok rule) can serve as a strongly action-guiding principle for utilitarian concerns. I also show how the notion of existential risk suggests a new way of thinking about the ideal of sustainability. Policy Implications • Existential risk is a concept that can focus long-term global efforts and sustainability concerns. • The biggest existential risks are anthropogenic and related to potential future technologies. • A moral case can be made that existential risk reduction is strictly more important than any other global public good. • Sustainability should be reconceptualised in dynamic terms, as aiming for a sustainable trajectory rather than a sustainable state. • Some small existential risks can be mitigated today directly (e.g. asteroids) or indirectly (by building resilience and reserves to increase survivability in a range of extreme scenarios) but it is more important to build capacity to improve humanity’s ability to deal with the larger existential risks that will arise later in this century. This will require collective wisdom, technology foresight, and the ability when necessary to mobilise a strong global coordinated response to anticipated existential risks. • Perhaps the most cost-effective way to reduce existential risks today is to fund analysis of a wide range of existential risks and potential mitigation strategies, with a long-term perspective.",2013,2022-01-30 4:53:10,2022-01-30 4:53:10,2019-12-19 1:40:49,15-31,,1,4,,,,,,,,,,en,"© 2013 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",,,,Wiley Online Library,,ZSCC: 0000462,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/GQZJQ458/1758-5899.html,,MetaSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, how does it start causing damage? Second, how does it reach the scale of a global catastrophe? Third, how does it reach everyone? In all of these three phases there is a defence layer that blocks most risks: First, we can prevent catastrophes from occurring. Second, we can respond to catastrophes before they reach a global scale. Third, humanity is resilient against extinction even in the face of global catastrophes. The largest probability of extinction is posed when all of these defences are weak, that is, by risks we are unlikely to prevent, unlikely to successfully respond to, and unlikely to be resilient against. We find that it’s usually best to invest significantly into strengthening all three defence layers. We also suggest ways to do so tailored to the classes of risk we identify. Lastly, we discuss the importance of underlying risk factors – events or structural conditions that may weaken the defence layers even without posing a risk of immediate extinction themselves.",2020,2022-01-30 4:53:09,2022-01-30 4:53:09,2020-08-18 21:30:09,271-282,,3,11,,,Defence in Depth Against Human Extinction,,,,,,,en,© 2020 The Authors.

The combination of AI and biotechnology could potentially lead to breakthroughs in precision medicine, improved biosurveillance, and discovery of novel medical countermeasures as well as facilitate a more effective public health emergency response. However, as is the case with many preceding transformative technologies, new opportunities often present new risks in parallel. Understanding the current and emerging risks at the intersection of AI and biotechnology is crucial for health security specialists and unlikely to be achieved by examining either ﬁeld in isolation. Uncertainties multiply as technologies merge, showcasing the need to identify robust assessment frameworks that could adequately analyze the risk landscape emerging at the convergence of these 2 domains.

In this paper, we use an intuitive yet precise graphical model called causal influence diagrams to formalize reward tampering problems. We also describe a number of modifications to the reinforcement learning objective that prevent incentives for reward tampering. We verify the solutions using recently developed graphical criteria for inferring agent incentives from causal influence diagrams.

This question is often the focus of policy and theoretical debates, where the label “strategic” designates those assets that warrant the attention of the highest levels of the state. But these conversations are plagued by analytical confusion, flawed heuristics, and the rhetorical use of “strategic” to advance particular agendas. We aim to improve these conversations through conceptual clarification, introducing a theory based on important rivalrous externalities for which socially optimal behavior will not be produced alone by markets or individual national security entities. We distill and theorize the most important three forms of these externalities, which involve cumulative-, infrastructure-, and dependency-strategic logics. We then employ these logics to clarify three important cases: the Avon 2 engine in the 1950s, the U.S.-Japan technology rivalry in the late 1980s, and contemporary conversations about artificial intelligence.",2021-06-03,2022-01-30 4:53:36,2022-01-30 4:53:36,,182-212,,2,30,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: 0000005,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/ZSBT2TB2/Ding and Dafoe - The Logic of Strategic Assets From Oil to AI.pdf,,MetaSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Others have created metrics to predict new patterns in job automation vulnerability. As context to such claims, we test basic theory, two vulnerability metrics, and 251 O*NET job features as predictors of 1505 expert reports regarding automation levels in 832 U.S. job types from 1999 to 2019. We find that pay, employment, and vulnerability metrics are predictive (R^2~0.15), but add little to the top 25 O*NET job features, which together predict far better (R^2~0.55). These best predictors seem understandable in terms of traditional kinds of automation, and have not changed over our time period. Instead, it seems that jobs have changed their features to become more suitable for automation. We thus find no evidence yet of a revolution in the patterns or quantity of automation. And since, over this period, automation increases have predicted neither changes in pay nor employment, this suggests that workers have little to fear if such a revolution does come.",2020-08,2022-01-30 4:53:36,2022-01-30 4:53:36,2020-12-19 5:22:30,,,,193,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,papers.ssrn.com,,ZSCC: 0000002  DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.3496364,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/5K2P6H4X/papers.html,,MetaSafety; FHI,artificial intelligence; automation; employment; occupations; technology; wages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, a worldwide pandemic or asteroid impact could potentially kill more than a billion people. Comfortingly, scientific calcultions often put very low probabilities on the occurrence of such catastrophes. In this paper, we argue that there are important new methodological problems which arise when assessing global catastrophic risks and we focus on a problem regarding probability estimation. When an expert provides a calculation of the probability of an outcome, they are really providing the probability of the outcome occurring, given that their argument is watertight. However, their argument may fail for a number of reasons, such as a flaw in the underlying theory, a flaw in the modelling of the problem or a mistake in the calculations. If the probability estimate given by an argument is dwarfed by the chance that the argument itself is flawed, then the estimate is suspect. We develop this idea formally, explaining how it differs from the related distinction between model and parameter uncertainty. Using the risk estimates from the Large Hadron Collider as a test case, we show how serious the problem can be when it comes to catastrophic risks and how best to address it.",2010-03-01,2022-01-30 4:53:19,2022-01-30 4:53:19,2019-12-19 1:43:42,191-205,,2,13,,,Probing the improbable,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,ZSCC: 0000075,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/WAX69HQK/13669870903126267.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/GAC3SCP9/Ord et al. - 2010 - Probing the improbable methodological challenges .pdf,,MetaSafety; FHI,calculation error; high stakes; low probability; particle accelerator; risk analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this Perspective, we reflect on a governance initiative by one of the world’s largest AI conferences. In 2020, the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) introduced a requirement for submitting authors to include a statement on the broader societal impacts of their research. Drawing insights from similar governance initiatives, including institutional review boards (IRBs) and impact requirements for funding applications, we investigate the risks, challenges and potential benefits of such an initiative. Among the challenges, we list a lack of recognized best practice and procedural transparency, researcher opportunity costs, institutional and social pressures, cognitive biases and the inherently difficult nature of the task. The potential benefits, on the other hand, include improved anticipation and identification of impacts, better communication with policy and governance experts, and a general strengthening of the norms around responsible research. To maximize the chance of success, we recommend measures to increase transparency, improve guidance, create incentives to engage earnestly with the process, and facilitate public deliberation on the requirement’s merits and future.

Which combination of people’s desires should a decisionmaker serve? To provide a potential answer, we turned to psychology: What do people think is best when multiple people have different utilities over options? We developed a quantitative model of what people consider desirable behavior, characterizing participants’ preferences by inferring which combination of “metrics” (maximax, maxsum, maximin, or inequality aversion [IA]) best explained participants’ decisions in a drink-choosing task. We found that participants’ behavior was best described by the maximin metric, describing the desire to maximize the happiness of the worst-off person, though participant behavior was also consistent with maximizing group utility (the maxsum metric) and the IA metric to a lesser extent. Participant behavior was consistent across variation in the agents involved and tended to become more maxsum-oriented when participants were told they were players in the task (Experiment 1). In later experiments, participants maintained maximin behavior across multi-step tasks rather than shortsightedly focusing on the individual steps therein (Experiment 2, Experiment 3). By repeatedly asking participants what choices they would hope for in an optimal, just decision-maker, and carefully disambiguating which quantitative metrics describe these nuanced choices, we help constrain the space of what behavior we desire in leaders, artiﬁcial intelligence systems helping decision-makers, and the assistive robots and decision-makers of the future.",2020-06,2022-01-30 4:50:53,2022-01-30 4:50:53,2020-11-21 18:26:49,,,6,44,,Cogn Sci,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: 0000003,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/F6HG3522/Gates et al. - 2020 - How to Be Helpful to Multiple People at Once.pdf,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many situations this is an unrealistic assumption. We develop a framework for reasoning about games where the players may be translucent to one another; in particular, a player may believe that if she were to change strategies, then the other player would also change strategies. Translucent players may achieve significantly more efficient outcomes than opaque ones. Our main result is a characterization of strategies consistent with appropriate analogues of common belief of rationality. Common Counterfactual Belief of Rationality (CCBR) holds if (1) everyone is rational, (2) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational (i.e., all players i believe that everyone else would still be rational even if $i$ were to switch strategies), (3) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and so on.

Since a robot's behavior is often a direct result of its underlying objective function, our insight is that end-users need to have an accurate mental model of this objective function in order to understand and predict what the robot will do. While people naturally develop such a mental model over time through observing the robot act, this familiarization process may be lengthy. Our approach reduces this time by having the robot model how people infer objectives from observed behavior, and then it selects those behaviors that are maximally informative. The problem of computing a posterior over objectives from observed behavior is known as Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and has been applied to robots learning human objectives. We consider the problem where the roles of human and robot are swapped. Our main contribution is to recognize that unlike robots, humans will not be exact in their IRL inference. We thus introduce two factors to define candidate approximate-inference models for human learning in this setting, and analyze them in a user study in the autonomous driving domain. We show that certain approximate-inference models lead to the robot generating example behaviors that better enable users to anticipate what it will do in novel situations. Our results also suggest, however, that additional research is needed in modeling how humans extrapolate from examples of robot behavior.",2017-02-11,2022-01-30 4:50:45,2022-01-30 4:50:45,2019-12-18 1:39:51,,,,43,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arxiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000002,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/XI6MUDJM/Huang et al. - 2017 - Enabling Robots to Communicate their Objectives.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/3W9QBCM2/1702.html,,CHAI; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Commonly, practitioners employ predictive models to reason about where other agents are going to move. Though there has been much recent work in building predictive models, no model is ever perfect: an agent can always move unexpectedly, in a way that is not predicted or not assigned sufficient probability. In such cases, the robot may plan trajectories that appear safe but, in fact, lead to collision. Rather than trust a model’s predictions blindly, we propose that the robot should use the model’s current predictive accuracy to inform the degree of confidence in its future predictions. This model confidence inference allows us to generate probabilistic motion predictions that exploit modeled structure when the structure successfully explains human motion, and degrade gracefully whenever the human moves unexpectedly. We accomplish this by maintaining a Bayesian belief over a single parameter that governs the variance of our human motion model. We couple this prediction algorithm with a recently proposed robust motion planner and controller to guide the construction of robot trajectories that are, to a good approximation, collision-free with a high, user-specified probability. We provide extensive analysis of the combined approach and its overall safety properties by establishing a connection to reachability analysis, and conclude with a hardware demonstration in which a small quadcopter operates safely in the same space as a human pedestrian.",2019-06-24,2022-01-30 4:50:43,2022-01-30 4:50:43,2019-07-08 16:10:37,27836491985943,,,,,The International Journal of Robotics Research,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s3]  ACC: 40,,,,CHAI; TechSafety,human motion prediction; motion planning; robust control; safety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is viewed as amongst the technological advances that will reshape modern societies and their relations. Whilst the design and deployment of systems that continually adapt holds the promise of far-reaching positive change, they simultaneously pose significant risks, especially to already vulnerable peoples. Values and power are central to this discussion. Decolonial theories use historical hindsight to explain patterns of power that shape our intellectual, political, economic, and social world. By embedding a decolonial critical approach within its technical practice, AI communities can develop foresight and tactics that can better align research and technology development with established ethical principles, centring vulnerable peoples who continue to bear the brunt of negative impacts of innovation and scientific progress. We highlight problematic applications that are instances of coloniality, and using a decolonial lens, submit three tactics that can form a decolonial field of artificial intelligence: creating a critical technical practice of AI, seeking reverse tutelage and reverse pedagogies, and the renewal of affective and political communities. The years ahead will usher in a wave of new scientific breakthroughs and technologies driven by AI research, making it incumbent upon AI communities to strengthen the social contract through ethical foresight and the multiplicity of intellectual perspectives available to us; ultimately supporting future technologies that enable greater well-being, with the goal of beneficence and justice for all.",2020-12,2022-01-30 4:52:38,2022-01-30 4:52:38,2020-12-12 15:23:49,659-684,,4,33,,Philos.

Ideally, the value of a reinforcement learner's policy approaches optimality--where the optimal informed policy is the one which maximizes reward. Unfortunately, we show that if an agent is guaranteed to be ""asymptotically optimal"" in any (stochastically computable) environment, then subject to an assumption about the true environment, this agent will be either destroyed or incapacitated with probability 1; both of these are forms of traps as understood in the Markov Decision Process literature. Environments with traps pose a well-known problem for agents, but we are unaware of other work which shows that traps are not only a risk, but a certainty, for agents of a certain caliber. Much work in reinforcement learning uses an ergodicity assumption to avoid this problem. Often, doing theoretical research under simplifying assumptions prepares us to provide practical solutions even in the absence of those assumptions, but the ergodicity assumption in reinforcement learning may have led us entirely astray in preparing safe and effective exploration strategies for agents in dangerous environments. Rather than assuming away the problem, we present an agent with the modest guarantee of approaching the performance of a mentor, doing safe exploration instead of reckless exploration.",2021-05-14,2022-01-30 4:52:38,2022-01-30 4:52:38,2020-09-05 17:28:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000000  arXiv: 2006.03357,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/3TP7IVVC/Cohen and Hutter - 2020 - Curiosity Killed the Cat and the Asymptotically Op.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/ANRSI6HU/2006.html,,TechSafety; DeepMind,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; I.2.0; I.2.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It defends three propositions. First, normative and technical aspects of the AI alignment problem are interrelated, creating space for productive engagement between people working in both domains. Second, it is important to be clear about the goal of alignment. There are significant differences between AI that aligns with instructions, intentions, revealed preferences, ideal preferences, interests and values. A principle-based approach to AI alignment, which combines these elements in a systematic way, has considerable advantages in this context. Third, the central challenge for theorists is not to identify 'true' moral principles for AI; rather, it is to identify fair principles for alignment, that receive reflective endorsement despite widespread variation in people's moral beliefs. The final part of the paper explores three ways in which fair principles for AI alignment could potentially be identified.",2020-01-13,2022-01-30 4:52:37,2022-01-30 4:52:37,2020-08-18 21:26:03,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000062  arXiv: 2001.09768,,"/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/2GPMB6EI/Gabriel - 2020 - Artificial Intelligence, Values and Alignment.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/M2KN5UVP/2001.html",,TechSafety; DeepMind,Computer Science - Computers and Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preventing them is the common interest of many different value systems. Furthermore, we argue that in the same way as superintelligent AI both contributes to existential risk but can also help prevent it, superintelligent AI can both be a suffering risk or help avoid it.

First, we claim that that the appropriate response to normative uncertainty is to hedge one’s bets. That is, if the stakes are much higher on one theory than another, and the credences you assign to each of these theories aren’t very different, then it’s appropriate to choose the option which performs best on the high-stakes theory. Second, we show that, given the assumption of altruism, the existence of correlated decision-makers will increase the stakes for EDT but leave the stakes for CDT unaffected.

We present some new counterexamples, including one in which the optimal action is causally dominated. We also present a novel decision theory, Functional Decision Theory (fdt), which simultaneously solves both sets of counterexamples. Instead of considering which physical action of theirs would give rise to the best outcomes, fdt agents consider which output of their decision function would give rise to the best outcome. This theory relies on a notion of subjunctive dependence, where multiple implementations of the same mathematical function are considered (even counterfactually) to have identical results for logical rather than causal reasons. Taking these subjunctive dependencies into account allows fdt agents to outperform cdt and edt agents in, e.g., the presence of accurate predictors. While not necessary for considering classic decision theory problems, we note that a full speciﬁcation of fdt will require a non-trivial theory of logical counterfactuals and algorithmic similarity.",2020,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2022-01-30 4:56:47,2020-12-13 21:01:53,237-266,,5,117,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: 0000011[s0],,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/PP23HCQJ/Levinstein et al. - 2020 - Cheating Death in Damascus.pdf,,TechSafety; MIRI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decision theories guide our choice by making normative claims about how we should respond to this uncertainty. If we are unsure which decision theory is correct, however, we may remain unsure of what we ought to do. Given this decision-theoretic uncertainty, meta-theories attempt to resolve the conflicts between our decision theories...but we may be unsure which meta-theory is correct as well. This reasoning can launch a regress of ever-higher-order uncertainty, which may leave one forever uncertain about what one ought to do. There is, fortunately, a class of circumstances under which this regress is not a problem. If one holds a cardinal understanding of subjective choiceworthiness, and accepts certain other criteria (which are too weak to specify any particular decision theory), one’s hierarchy of metanormative uncertainty ultimately converges to precise definitions of “subjective choiceworthiness” for any finite set of acts. If one allows the metanormative regress to extend to the transfinite ordinals, the convergence criteria can be weakened further.

This article builds on BRF’s valuable contribution. First, this article describes the conceptual and mathematical relationship between the probability of existential catastrophe and the severity of events that could result in existential catastrophe. It discusses complications in this relationship arising from catastrophes occurring at different speeds and from multiple concurrent catastrophes. Second, this article revisits the ten BRF methodologies, finding an inverse relationship between a methodology’s ease of use and the quality of results it produces—in other words, achieving a higher quality of analysis will in general require a larger investment in analysis. Third, the manuscript discusses the role of probability quantification in the management of existential risks, describing why the probability is only sometimes needed for decision-making and arguing that analyses should support real-world risk management decisions and not just be academic exercises. If the findings of this article are taken into account, together with BRF’s evaluations of specific methodologies, then risk analyses of existential catastrophe may tend to be more successful at understanding and reducing the risks.",2020-10-01,2022-01-30 4:55:20,2022-01-30 4:55:20,2020-12-19 3:08:57,102608,,,123,,Futures,Quantifying the probability of existential catastrophe,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,ZSCC: 0000002,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/TFM6GRAD/S0016328720300987.html,,MetaSafety; AmbiguosSafety; GCRI,Existential risk; Global catastrophic risk; Probability; Risk analysis; Severity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is found in the AI ethics of “coherent extrapolated volition” and “bottom-up ethics”. This paper shows that the normative basis of AI social choice ethics is weak due to the fact that there is no one single aggregate ethical view of society. Instead, the design of social choice AI faces three sets of decisions: standing, concerning whose ethics views are included; measurement, concerning how their views are identified; and aggregation, concerning how individual views are combined to a single view that will guide AI behavior. These decisions must be made up front in the initial AI design—designers cannot “let the AI figure it out”. Each set of decisions poses difficult ethical dilemmas with major consequences for AI behavior, with some decision options yielding pathological or even catastrophic results. Furthermore, non-social choice ethics face similar issues, such as whether to count future generations or the AI itself. These issues can be more important than the question of whether or not to use social choice ethics. Attention should focus on these issues, not on social choice.",2020-03-01,2022-01-30 4:55:20,2022-01-30 4:55:20,2020-08-20 20:16:41,165-176,,1,35,,AI & Soc,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,ZSCC: 0000060,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/5EKPE8IC/Baum - 2017 - Social Choice Ethics in Artificial Intelligence.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/NNB6BD38/Baum - 2020 - Social choice ethics in artificial intelligence.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/JZWAP722/papers.html,,MetaSafety; AmbiguosSafety; GCRI,artificial intelligence; bottom-up ethics; coherent extrapolated volition; ethics; social choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Medium-term AI can be important in its own right and as a topic that can bridge the sometimes acrimonious divide between those who favor attention to near-term AI and those who prefer the long-term. The paper proposes the medium-term AI hypothesis: the medium-term is important from the perspectives of those who favor attention to near-term AI as well as those who favor attention to long-term AI. The paper analyzes medium-term AI in terms of governance institutions, collective action, corporate AI development, and military/national security communities.

This paper surveys opportunities to improve how corporations govern their AI activities so as to better advance the public interest. The paper focuses on the roles of and opportunities for a wide range of actors inside the corporation—managers, workers, and investors—and outside the corporation—corporate partners and competitors, industry consortia, nonprofit organizations, the public, the media, and governments. Whereas prior work on multistakeholder AI governance has proposed dedicated institutions to bring together diverse actors and stakeholders, this paper explores the opportunities they have even in the absence of dedicated multistakeholder institutions. The paper illustrates these opportunities with many cases, including the participation of Google in the U.S. Department of Defense Project Maven; the publication of potentially harmful AI research by OpenAI, with input from the Partnership on AI; and the sale of facial recognition technology to law enforcement by corporations including Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft.

Problems such as environmental protection, public health, and emerging technology governance do not fit neatly within traditional academic disciplines and therefore require an interdisciplinary approach. However, interdisciplinary research poses large cognitive challenges for human researchers that go beyond the substantial challenges of narrow disciplinary research. The challenges include epistemic divides between disciplines, the massive bodies of relevant literature, the peer review of work that integrates an eclectic mix of topics, and the transfer of interdisciplinary research insights from one problem to another. Artificial interdisciplinarity already helps with these challenges via search engines, recommendation engines, and automated content analysis. Future “strong artificial interdisciplinarity” based on human-level artificial general intelligence could excel at interdisciplinary research, but it may take a long time to develop and could pose major safety and ethical issues. Therefore, there is an important role for intermediate-term artificial interdisciplinarity systems that could make major contributions to addressing societal problems without the concerns associated with artificial general intelligence.",2020-07-16,2022-01-30 4:55:19,2022-01-30 4:55:19,2020-08-20 20:15:09,,,,,,Philos.

This classification allows the identification of several new risks. We show that at each level of AI’s intelligence power, separate types of possible catastrophes dominate. Our classification demonstrates that the field of AI risks is diverse, and includes many scenarios beyond the commonly discussed cases of a paperclip maximizer or robot-caused unemployment. Global catastrophic failure could happen at various levels of AI development, namely, (1) before it starts self-improvement, (2) during its takeoff, when it uses various instruments to escape its initial confinement, or (3) after it successfully takes over the world and starts to implement its goal system, which could be plainly unaligned, or feature-flawed friendliness. AI could also halt at later stages of its development either due to technical glitches or ontological problems. Overall, we identified around several dozen scenarios of AI-driven global catastrophe.

This “randomized smoothing” technique has been proposed recently in the literature, but existing guarantees are loose. We prove a tight robustness guarantee in 2 norm for smoothing with Gaussian noise. We use randomized smoothing to obtain an ImageNet classiﬁer with e.g. a certiﬁed top-1 accuracy of 49% under adversarial perturbations with 2 norm less than 0.5 (=127/255). No certiﬁed defense has been shown feasible on ImageNet except for smoothing. On smaller-scale datasets where competing approaches to certiﬁed 2 robustness are viable, smoothing delivers higher certiﬁed accuracies.

First, we overview the existing research and commercial work performed by a select number of startups and academic projects. We find that at the current stage of “narrow” AI, the most promising areas for life extension are geroprotector-combination discovery, detection of aging biomarkers, and personalized anti-aging therapy. These advances could help currently living people reach longevity escape velocity and survive until more advanced AI appears. When AI comes close to human level, the main contribution to life extension will come from AI integration with humans through brain-computer interfaces, integrated AI assistants capable of autonomously diagnosing and treating health issues, and cyber systems embedded into human bodies. Lastly, we speculate about the more remote future, when AI reaches the level of superintelligence and such life-extension methods as uploading human minds and creating nanotechnological bodies may become possible, thus lowering the probability of human death close to zero. We conclude that medical AI based superintelligence is intrinsically safer than, say, military AI, as it may help humans to evolve into part of the future superintelligence via brain augmentation, uploading, and a network of self-improving humans.

Using the longer track record of survival for our entire genus Homo produces even tighter bounds, with an annual probability of natural extinction likely below one in 870,000. These bounds are unlikely to be affected by possible survivorship bias in the data, and are consistent with mammalian extinction rates, typical hominin species lifespans, the frequency of well-characterized risks, and the frequency of mass extinctions.

However, the ways in which AI systems approach problems are often different from the ways people do, and thus may be uninterpretable and hard to learn from. A crucial step in bridging this gap between human and artificial intelligence is modeling the granular actions that constitute human behavior, rather than simply matching aggregate human performance. We pursue this goal in a model system with a long history in artificial intelligence: chess. The aggregate performance of a chess player unfolds as they make decisions over the course of a game. The hundreds of millions of games played online by players at every skill level form a rich source of data in which these decisions, and their exact context, are recorded in minute detail. Applying existing chess engines to this data, including an open-source implementation of AlphaZero, we find that they do not predict human moves well. We develop and introduce Maia, a customized version of Alpha-Zero trained on human chess games, that predicts human moves at a much higher accuracy than existing engines, and can achieve maximum accuracy when predicting decisions made by players at a specific skill level in a tuneable way. For a dual task of predicting whether a human will make a large mistake on the next move, we develop a deep neural network that significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Taken together, our results suggest that there is substantial promise in designing artificial intelligence systems with human collaboration in mind by first accurately modeling granular human decision-making.",2020-08-23,2022-01-30 4:59:34,2022-01-30 4:59:34,2020-11-14 0:50:30,1677-1687,,,,,,Aligning Superhuman AI with Human Behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000023  arXiv: 2006.01855,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/EHATD65D/McIlroy-Young et al. - 2020 - Aligning Superhuman AI with Human Behavior Chess .pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/C93VXAWD/2006.html,,TechSafety; Other-org,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computers and Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, a number of thinkers have argued that accelerating trends in computer science, cognitive science, and related disciplines foreshadow the creation of intelligent machines which meet and ultimately surpass the cognitive abilities of human beings, thereby entangling an understanding of human values with future technological development. Contemporary research accomplishments suggest sophisticated AI systems becoming widespread and responsible for managing many aspects of the modern world, from preemptively planning users' travel schedules and logistics, to fully autonomous vehicles, to domestic robots assisting in daily living. The extrapolation of these trends has been most forcefully described in the context of a hypothetical ""intelligence explosion,"" in which the capabilities of an intelligent software agent would rapidly increase due to the presence of feedback loops unavailable to biological organisms. The possibility of superintelligent agents, or simply the widespread deployment of sophisticated, autonomous AI systems, highlights an important theoretical problem: the need to separate the cognitive and rational capacities of an agent from the fundamental goal structure, or value system, which constrains and guides the agent's actions. The ""value alignment problem"" is to specify a goal structure for autonomous agents compatible with human values. In this brief article, we suggest that recent ideas from affective neuroscience and related disciplines aimed at characterizing neurological and behavioral universals in the mammalian class provide important conceptual foundations relevant to describing human values.

We demonstrate that these alignment frameworks can be represented as utility functions, but that the widely used Maximum Expected Utility (MEU) paradigm provides insufficient support for such multiobjective decision-making.

These risks share the prospect of causing outright human extinction were they to occur. In this approach, such identified existential risks are frequently characterised by relatively singular origin events and concrete pathways of harm which directly jeopardise the survival of humanity, or undercut its potential for long-term technological progress. While this approach aptly identifies the most cataclysmic fates which may befall humanity, we argue that catastrophic ‘existential outcomes’ may likely arise from a broader range of sources and societal vulnerabilities, and through the complex interactions of disparate social, cultural, and natural processes—many of which, taken in isolation, might not be seen to merit attention as a global catastrophic, let alone existential, risk. This article argues that an emphasis on mitigating the hazards (discrete causes) of existential risks is an unnecessarily narrow framing of the challenge facing humanity, one which risks prematurely curtailing the spectrum of policy responses considered. Instead, it argues existential risks constitute but a subset in a broader set of challenges which could directly or indirectly contribute to existential consequences for humanity. To illustrate, we introduce and examine a set of existential risks that often fall outside the scope of, or remain understudied within, the field. By focusing on vulnerability and exposure rather than existential hazards, we develop a new taxonomy which captures factors contributing to these existential risks. Latent structural vulnerabilities in our technological systems and in our societal arrangements may increase our susceptibility to existential hazards. Finally, different types of exposure of our society or its natural base determine if or how a given hazard can interface with pre-existing vulnerabilities, to trigger emergent existential risks. We argue that far from being peripheral footnotes to their more direct and immediately terminal counterparts, these “Boring Apocalypses” may well prove to be the more endemic and problematic, dragging down and undercutting short-term successes in mitigating more spectacular risks. If the cardinal concern is humanity’s continued survival and prosperity, then focussing academic and public advocacy efforts on reducing direct existential hazards may have the paradoxical potential of exacerbating humanity’s indirect susceptibility to such outcomes. Adopting law and policy perspectives allow us to foreground societal dimensions that complement and reinforce the discourse on existential risks.",2018-09-01,2022-01-30 4:59:56,2022-01-30 4:59:56,2020-12-13 23:17:16,6-19,,,102,,Futures,Governing Boring Apocalypses,Futures of research in catastrophic and existential risk,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,ZSCC: 0000030,,,,MetaSafety; AmbiguosSafety; Other-org,Boring Apocalypse; Civilisational collapse; Existential Risks; Exposure; Vulnerability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in reality, people make many important decisions under uncertainty. To better understand preference learning in these cases, we study the setting of inverse decision theory (IDT), a previously proposed framework where a human is observed making non-sequential binary decisions under uncertainty. In IDT, the human's preferences are conveyed through their loss function, which expresses a tradeoff between different types of mistakes. We give the first statistical analysis of IDT, providing conditions necessary to identify these preferences and characterizing the sample complexity -- the number of decisions that must be observed to learn the tradeoff the human is making to a desired precision. Interestingly, we show that it is actually easier to identify preferences when the decision problem is more uncertain. Furthermore, uncertain decision problems allow us to relax the unrealistic assumption that the human is an optimal decision maker but still identify their exact preferences; we give sample complexities in this suboptimal case as well. Our analysis contradicts the intuition that partial observability should make preference learning more difficult. It also provides a first step towards understanding and improving preference learning methods for uncertain and suboptimal humans.",2021-10-28,2022-03-09 22:57:56,2022-03-09 22:57:56,2022-03-09 22:57:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2106.10394,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/THNL7BX9/Laidlaw and Russell - 2021 - Uncertain Decisions Facilitate Better Preference L.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/EN2IKJX3/2106.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, artificial agents are currently not endowed with a moral sense. As a consequence, they may learn to behave immorally when trained on environments that ignore moral concerns, such as violent video games. With the advent of generally capable agents that pretrain on many environments, it will become necessary to mitigate inherited biases from environments that teach immoral behavior. To facilitate the development of agents that avoid causing wanton harm, we introduce Jiminy Cricket, an environment suite of 25 text-based adventure games with thousands of diverse, morally salient scenarios. By annotating every possible game state, the Jiminy Cricket environments robustly evaluate whether agents can act morally while maximizing reward. Using models with commonsense moral knowledge, we create an elementary artificial conscience that assesses and guides agents.

This approach is intended to provide value for a principal: the user on whose behalf the agent acts. The objectives given to these agents often refer to a partial specification of the principal's goals. We consider the cost of this incompleteness by analyzing a model of a principal and an agent in a resource constrained world where the $L$ attributes of the state correspond to different sources of utility for the principal. We assume that the reward function given to the agent only has support on $J < L$ attributes. The contributions of our paper are as follows: 1) we propose a novel model of an incomplete principal-agent problem from artificial intelligence; 2) we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which indefinitely optimizing for any incomplete proxy objective leads to arbitrarily low overall utility; and 3) we show how modifying the setup to allow reward functions that reference the full state or allowing the principal to update the proxy objective over time can lead to higher utility solutions.

As such, these systems are now being incorporated into commercial products. With this comes an additional challenge: how can we build AI systems that solve tasks where there is not a crisp, well-defined specification? While multiple solutions have been proposed, in this competition we focus on one in particular: learning from human feedback. Rather than training AI systems using a predefined reward function or using a labeled dataset with a predefined set of categories, we instead train the AI system using a learning signal derived from some form of human feedback, which can evolve over time as the understanding of the task changes, or as the capabilities of the AI system improve. The MineRL BASALT competition aims to spur forward research on this important class of techniques. We design a suite of four tasks in Minecraft for which we expect it will be hard to write down hardcoded reward functions. These tasks are defined by a paragraph of natural language: for example, ""create a waterfall and take a scenic picture of it"", with additional clarifying details. Participants must train a separate agent for each task, using any method they want. Agents are then evaluated by humans who have read the task description. To help participants get started, we provide a dataset of human demonstrations on each of the four tasks, as well as an imitation learning baseline that leverages these demonstrations. Our hope is that this competition will improve our ability to build AI systems that do what their designers intend them to do, even when the intent cannot be easily formalized.

Are modern deep neural networks locally specialized? How can this be quantified? In this paper, we consider the problem of taking a neural network whose neurons are partitioned into clusters, and quantifying how functionally specialized the clusters are. We propose two proxies for this: importance, which reflects how crucial sets of neurons are to network performance; and coherence, which reflects how consistently their neurons associate with features of the inputs. To measure these proxies, we develop a set of statistical methods based on techniques conventionally used to interpret individual neurons. We apply the proxies to partitionings generated by spectrally clustering a graph representation of the network's neurons with edges determined either by network weights or correlations of activations. We show that these partitionings, even ones based only on weights (i.e. strictly from non-runtime analysis), reveal groups of neurons that are important and coherent.

Recent work proposed that agents have access to a source of information that is effectively free: in any environment that humans have acted in, the state will already be optimized for human preferences, and thus an agent can extract information about what humans want from the state. Such learning is possible in principle, but requires simulating all possible past trajectories that could have led to the observed state. This is feasible in gridworlds, but how do we scale it to complex tasks? In this work, we show that by combining a learned feature encoder with learned inverse models, we can enable agents to simulate human actions backwards in time to infer what they must have done.

This motivates our key insight: when a robot is deployed in an environment that humans act in, the state of the environment is already optimized for what humans want. We can therefore use this implicit preference information from the state to fill in the blanks. We develop an algorithm based on Maximum Causal Entropy IRL and use it to evaluate the idea in a suite of proof-of-concept environments designed to show its properties.

We pair the new objective with a provably convergent algorithm, giving rise to a new intrinsic reward that adjusts existing bonuses. The proposed intrinsic reward is easy to implement and combine with other existing RL algorithms to conduct exploration. As a proof of concept, we evaluate the new intrinsic reward on tabular examples across a variety of model-based and model-free algorithms, showing improvements over count-only exploration strategies. When tested on navigation and locomotion tasks from MiniGrid and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks, our approach significantly improves sample efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.

Discussions of reputation focus almost exclusively on first-order belief change—A stands firm, B updates its beliefs about A’s resolve. Such first-order reputational effects are important, but they are not the whole story. Higher-order beliefs—what A believes about B’s beliefs, and so on—matter a great deal as well. When A comes to believe that B is more resolved, this may decrease A’s resolve, and this in turn may increase B’s resolve, and so on. In other words, resolve is interdependent. We offer a framework for estimating higher-order effects, and find evidence of such reasoning in a survey experiment on quasi-elites. Our findings indicate both that states and leaders can develop potent reputations for resolve, and that higher-order beliefs are often responsible for a large proportion of these effects (40 percent to 70 percent in our experimental setting). We conclude by complementing the survey with qualitative evidence and laying the groundwork for future research.",2021-08-01,2022-03-09 23:04:04,2022-03-09 23:04:04,2022-03-09 23:04:04,1378-1404,,7-8,65,,Journal of Conflict Resolution,,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/GXRYYKPK/Dafoe et al. - 2021 - Reputations for Resolve and Higher-Order Beliefs i.pdf,,,bargaining; belief structure; conflict; game theory; survey experiment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arguably the most profound military implications of technological change, however, come from more fundamental advances arising from general purpose technologies, such as the steam engine, electricity, and the computer. With few exceptions, political scientists have not theorized about GPTs. Drawing from the economics literature on GPTs, we distill several propositions on how and when GPTs affect military affairs. We call these effects general-purpose military transformations. In particular, we argue that the impacts of GMTs on military effectiveness are broad, delayed, and shaped by indirect productivity spillovers. Additionally, GMTs differentially advantage those militaries that can draw from a robust industrial base in the GPT. To illustrate the explanatory value of our theory, we conduct a case study of the military consequences of electricity, the prototypical GPT.

In 2020, the machine learning (ML) conference NeurIPS broke new ground by requiring that all papers include a broader impact statement. This requirement was removed in 2021, in favour of a checklist approach. The 2020 statements therefore provide a unique opportunity to learn from the broader impact experiment: to investigate the benefits and challenges of this and similar governance mechanisms, as well as providing an insight into how ML researchers think about the societal impacts of their own work. Such learning is needed as NeurIPS and other venues continue to question and adapt their policies. To enable this, we have created a dataset containing the impact statements from all NeurIPS 2020 papers, along with additional information such as affiliation type, location and subject area, and a simple visualisation tool for exploration. We also provide an initial quantitative analysis of the dataset, covering representation, engagement, common themes, and willingness to discuss potential harms alongside benefits. We investigate how these vary by geography, affiliation type and subject area. Drawing on these findings, we discuss the potential benefits and negative outcomes of ethics statement requirements, and their possible causes and associated challenges. These lead us to several lessons to be learnt from the 2020 requirement: (i) the importance of creating the right incentives, (ii) the need for clear expectations and guidance, and (iii) the importance of transparency and constructive deliberation. We encourage other researchers to use our dataset to provide additional analysis, to further our understanding of how researchers responded to this requirement, and to investigate the benefits and challenges of this and related mechanisms.",2021-11-02,2022-03-09 23:05:17,2022-03-11 1:36:34,2022-03-09 23:05:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2111.01705,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/L4N8X3ZX/Ashurst et al. - 2021 - AI Ethics Statements -- Analysis and lessons learn.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9LMZ9EW5/2111.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/4Q8AYI5N/Ashurst et al. - 2021 - AI Ethics Statements -- Analysis and lessons learn.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/N43N7BRA/Ashurst et al. - 2021 - AI Ethics Statements -- Analysis and lessons learn.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/NEZNP4G3/2111.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/5BVM9QMS/2111.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying early warning signs of transformative applications can support more efficient monitoring and timely regulation of progress in AI: as AI advances, its impacts on society may be too great to be governed retrospectively.

No existing work provides formal guidance in how this might be accomplished, instead restricting focus to environments that restart, making learning unusually easy, and conveniently limiting the significance of any mistake. We address a fully general setting, in which the (stochastic) environment and demonstrator never reset, not even for training purposes. Our new conservative Bayesian imitation learner underestimates the probabilities of each available action, and queries for more data with the remaining probability.

Unlike the well-known ambiguity problems in IRL, this one is practically relevant but cannot be resolved by observing the agent's policy in enough environments. This paper shows (1) that a No Free Lunch result implies it is impossible to uniquely decompose a policy into a planning algorithm and reward function, and (2) that even with a reasonable simplicity prior/Occam's razor on the set of decompositions, we cannot distinguish between the true decomposition and others that lead to high regret.

Short-term impacts of increased openness appear mostly socially beneﬁcial in expectation. The strategic implications of medium and long-term impacts are complex. The evaluation of long-term impacts, in particular, may depend on whether the objective is to beneﬁt the present generation or to promote a time-neutral aggregate of well-being of future generations. Some forms of openness are plausibly positive on both counts (openness about safety measures, openness about goals). Others (openness about source code, science, and possibly capability) could lead to a tightening of the competitive situation around the time of the introduction of advanced AI, increasing the probability that winning the AI race is incompatible with using any safety method that incurs a delay or limits performance.

They can be found at scales ranging from our daily routines--such as driving on highways, scheduling meetings, and working collaboratively--to our global challenges--such as peace, commerce, and pandemic preparedness. Arguably, the success of the human species is rooted in our ability to cooperate. Since machines powered by artificial intelligence are playing an ever greater role in our lives, it will be important to equip them with the capabilities necessary to cooperate and to foster cooperation. We see an opportunity for the field of artificial intelligence to explicitly focus effort on this class of problems, which we term Cooperative AI. The objective of this research would be to study the many aspects of the problems of cooperation and to innovate in AI to contribute to solving these problems. Central goals include building machine agents with the capabilities needed for cooperation, building tools to foster cooperation in populations of (machine and/or human) agents, and otherwise conducting AI research for insight relevant to problems of cooperation. This research integrates ongoing work on multi-agent systems, game theory and social choice, human-machine interaction and alignment, natural-language processing, and the construction of social tools and platforms. However, Cooperative AI is not the union of these existing areas, but rather an independent bet about the productivity of specific kinds of conversations that involve these and other areas.

Nevertheless, this influential group's attitudes are not well understood, which undermines our ability to discern consensuses or disagreements between AI/ML researchers. To examine these researchers' views, we conducted a survey of those who published in the top AI/ML conferences (N = 524). We compare these results with those from a 2016 survey of AI/ML researchers (Grace, Salvatier, Dafoe, Zhang, & Evans, 2018) and a 2018 survey of the US public (Zhang & Dafoe, 2020). We find that AI/ML researchers place high levels of trust in international organizations and scientific organizations to shape the development and use of AI in the public interest; moderate trust in most Western tech companies; and low trust in national militaries, Chinese tech companies, and Facebook. While the respondents were overwhelmingly opposed to AI/ML researchers working on lethal autonomous weapons, they are less opposed to researchers working on other military applications of AI, particularly logistics algorithms. A strong majority of respondents think that AI safety research should be prioritized and that ML institutions should conduct pre-publication review to assess potential harms. Being closer to the technology itself, AI/ML re-searchers are well placed to highlight new risks and develop technical solutions, so this novel attempt to measure their attitudes has broad relevance.

Second, it is important to be clear about the goal of alignment. There are significant differences between AI that aligns with instructions, intentions, revealed preferences, ideal preferences, interests and values. A principle-based approach to AI alignment, which combines these elements in a systematic way, has considerable advantages in this context. Third, the central challenge for theorists is not to identify 'true' moral principles for AI; rather, it is to identify fair principles for alignment, that receive reflective endorsement despite widespread variation in people's moral beliefs.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.",2020-07-22,2022-03-10 20:38:32,2022-03-11 1:36:43,2022-03-10 20:38:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2005.14165,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/PUXYRW8X/Brown et al. - 2020 - Language Models are Few-Shot Learners.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/EJCL7RHC/Brown et al. - 2020 - Language Models are Few-Shot Learners.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/74LHPBWZ/2005.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/SARDP4KI/2005.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9HH92G2G/Brown et al. - 2020 - Language Models are Few-Shot Learners.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/PP7AKKE5/2005.html,,,Computer Science - Computation and Language,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present progress on this problem on the task of abstractive summarization of entire fiction novels. Our method combines learning from human feedback with recursive task decomposition: we use models trained on smaller parts of the task to assist humans in giving feedback on the broader task. We collect a large volume of demonstrations and comparisons from human labelers, and fine-tune GPT-3 using behavioral cloning and reward modeling to do summarization recursively. At inference time, the model first summarizes small sections of the book and then recursively summarizes these summaries to produce a summary of the entire book. Our human labelers are able to supervise and evaluate the models quickly, despite not having read the entire books themselves. Our resulting model generates sensible summaries of entire books, even matching the quality of human-written summaries in a few cases ($\sim5\%$ of books).

We define a universe of tasks within an environment domain and demonstrate the ability to train agents that are generally capable across this vast space and beyond. The environment is natively multi-agent, spanning the continuum of competitive, cooperative, and independent games, which are situated within procedurally generated physical 3D worlds. The resulting space is exceptionally diverse in terms of the challenges posed to agents, and as such, even measuring the learning progress of an agent is an open research problem. We propose an iterative notion of improvement between successive generations of agents, rather than seeking to maximise a singular objective, allowing us to quantify progress despite tasks being incomparable in terms of achievable rewards. We show that through constructing an open-ended learning process, which dynamically changes the training task distributions and training objectives such that the agent never stops learning, we achieve consistent learning of new behaviours. The resulting agent is able to score reward in every one of our humanly solvable evaluation levels, with behaviour generalising to many held-out points in the universe of tasks. Examples of this zero-shot generalisation include good performance on Hide and Seek, Capture the Flag, and Tag. Through analysis and hand-authored probe tasks we characterise the behaviour of our agent, and find interesting emergent heuristic behaviours such as trial-and-error experimentation, simple tool use, option switching, and cooperation.

In this paper, we ask: are there safe Pareto improvements on this default way of giving instructions? That is, we imagine that the original players can coordinate to tell their representatives to only consider some subset of the available strategies and to assign utilities to outcomes differently than the original players. Then can the original players do this in such a way that the payoff is guaranteed to be weakly higher than under the default instructions for all the original players? In particular, can they Pareto-improve without probabilistic assumptions about how the representatives play games? In this paper, we give some examples of safe Pareto improvements. We prove that the notion of safe Pareto improvements is closely related to a notion of outcome correspondence between games.

When we do the same for models pre-trained on a large language dataset, the slope in performance gains is merely reduced rather than going to zero. We calculate the effective data ""transferred"" from pre-training by determining how much data a transformer of the same size would have required to achieve the same loss when training from scratch. In other words, we focus on units of data while holding everything else fixed. We find that the effective data transferred is described well in the low data regime by a power-law of parameter count and fine-tuning dataset size. We believe the exponents in these power-laws correspond to measures of the generality of a model and proximity of distributions (in a directed rather than symmetric sense).

We use this procedure to answer several questions on interpretability in models for vision and natural language processing. First, we examine the kinds of abstractions learned by neurons. In image classification, we find that many neurons learn highly abstract but semantically coherent visual concepts, while other polysemantic neurons detect multiple unrelated features; in natural language inference (NLI), neurons learn shallow lexical heuristics from dataset biases. Second, we see whether compositional explanations give us insight into model performance: vision neurons that detect human-interpretable concepts are positively correlated with task performance, while NLI neurons that fire for shallow heuristics are negatively correlated with task performance.

Within this paper, we explore the use of new information theoretic techniques developed in the field of neuroscience to enable novel understanding of how a CNN represents information. We trained a 10-layer ResNet architecture to identify 2,000 face identities from 26M images generated using a rigorously controlled 3D face rendering model that produced variations of intrinsic (i.e. face morphology, gender, age, expression and ethnicity) and extrinsic factors (i.e. 3D pose, illumination, scale and 2D translation). With our methodology, we demonstrate that unlike human's network overgeneralizes face identities even with extreme changes of face shape, but it is more sensitive to changes of texture. To understand the processing of information underlying these counterintuitive properties, we visualize the features of shape and texture that the network processes to identify faces. Then, we shed a light into the inner workings of the black box and reveal how hidden layers represent these features and whether the representations are invariant to pose.

To overcome this limitation, we present a framework within which instruction-conditional RL agents are trained using rewards obtained not from the environment, but from reward models which are jointly trained from expert examples. As reward models improve, they learn to accurately reward agents for completing tasks for environment configurations---and for instructions---not present amongst the expert data. This framework effectively separates the representation of what instructions require from how they can be executed. In a simple grid world, it enables an agent to learn a range of commands requiring interaction with blocks and understanding of spatial relations and underspecified abstract arrangements. We further show the method allows our agent to adapt to changes in the environment without requiring new expert examples.",2019-12-23,2022-03-10 21:32:52,2022-03-10 21:32:52,2022-03-10 21:32:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1806.01946,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/SQVYQXKM/Bahdanau et al. - 2019 - Learning to Understand Goal Specifications by Mode.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/ZZZC8CB3/1806.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, real-world applications of reinforcement learning must specify the goal of the task by means of a manually programmed reward function, which in practice requires either designing the very same perception pipeline that end-to-end reinforcement learning promises to avoid, or else instrumenting the environment with additional sensors to determine if the task has been performed successfully. In this paper, we propose an approach for removing the need for manual engineering of reward specifications by enabling a robot to learn from a modest number of examples of successful outcomes, followed by actively solicited queries, where the robot shows the user a state and asks for a label to determine whether that state represents successful completion of the task. While requesting labels for every single state would amount to asking the user to manually provide the reward signal, our method requires labels for only a tiny fraction of the states seen during training, making it an efficient and practical approach for learning skills without manually engineered rewards. We evaluate our method on real-world robotic manipulation tasks where the observations consist of images viewed by the robot's camera. In our experiments, our method effectively learns to arrange objects, place books, and drape cloth, directly from images and without any manually specified reward functions, and with only 1-4 hours of interaction with the real world.",2019-05-15,2022-03-10 21:51:33,2022-03-10 21:51:33,2022-03-10 21:51:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1904.07854,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/5D3WPY5V/Singh et al. - 2019 - End-to-End Robotic Reinforcement Learning without .pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/U2WNAYI7/1904.html,,,Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Robotics; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the dataset shifts between the training and testing phase may lead the LECs to become ineffective to make large-error predictions, and further, compromise the safety of the overall system. In our paper, we first provide the formal definitions for different types of dataset shifts in learning-enabled CPS. Then, we propose an approach to detect the dataset shifts effectively for regression problems. Our approach is based on the inductive conformal anomaly detection and utilizes a variational autoencoder for regression model which enables the approach to take into consideration both LEC input and output for detecting dataset shifts. Additionally, in order to improve the robustness of detection, layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) is incorporated into our approach. We demonstrate our approach by using an advanced emergency braking system implemented in an open-source simulator for self-driving cars.

Over the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while making apparent the two historical conceptions of intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks such as board games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow experimenters to ""buy"" arbitrary levels of skills for a system, in a way that masks the system's own generalization power. We then articulate a new formal definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope, generalization difficulty, priors, and experience. Using this definition, we propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look like. Finally, we present a benchmark closely following these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general intelligence comparisons between AI systems and humans.",2019-11-25,2022-03-10 22:02:10,2022-03-10 22:02:10,2022-03-10 22:02:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1911.01547,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/S63K9L3I/Chollet - 2019 - On the Measure of Intelligence.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/SDFPCCLB/1911.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For instance, if the language is Peano arithmetic, it assigns probabilities to all arithmetical statements, including claims about the twin prime conjecture, the outputs of long-running computations, and its own probabilities. We show that our algorithm, an instance of what we call a logical inductor, satisfies a number of intuitive desiderata, including: (1) it learns to predict patterns of truth and falsehood in logical statements, often long before having the resources to evaluate the statements, so long as the patterns can be written down in polynomial time; (2) it learns to use appropriate statistical summaries to predict sequences of statements whose truth values appear pseudorandom; and (3) it learns to have accurate beliefs about its own current beliefs, in a manner that avoids the standard paradoxes of self-reference. For example, if a given computer program only ever produces outputs in a certain range, a logical inductor learns this fact in a timely manner; and if late digits in the decimal expansion of $\pi$ are difficult to predict, then a logical inductor learns to assign $\approx 10\%$ probability to ""the $n$th digit of $\pi$ is a 7"" for large $n$. Logical inductors also learn to trust their future beliefs more than their current beliefs, and their beliefs are coherent in the limit (whenever $\phi \implies \psi$, $\mathbb{P}_\infty(\phi) \le \mathbb{P}_\infty(\psi)$, and so on); and logical inductors strictly dominate the universal semimeasure in the limit. These properties and many others all follow from a single logical induction criterion, which is motivated by a series of stock trading analogies.

Adhering to this principle delivers a number of benefits, including the ability to maximize wealth in an array of traditional decision-theoretic and game-theoretic problems where CDT and EDT perform poorly.

However, these success stories are tainted by concerning reports on the lack of model transparency and bias against some medical conditions or patients' sub-groups. Explainable methods are considered the gateway to alleviate many of these concerns. In this study we demonstrate that the generated explanations are volatile to changes in model training that are perpendicular to the classification task and model structure. This raises further questions about trust in deep learning models for healthcare. Mainly, whether the models capture underlying causal links in the data or just rely on spurious correlations that are made visible via explanation methods. We demonstrate that the output of explainability methods on deep neural networks can vary significantly by changes of hyper-parameters, such as the random seed or how the training set is shuffled. We introduce a measure of explanation consistency which we use to highlight the identified problems on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. We find explanations of identical models but with different training setups have a low consistency: $\approx$ 33% on average.

An example is the use of the i.i.d. assumption in content recommendation. In fact, the (choice of) content displayed can change users' perceptions and preferences, or even drive them away, causing a shift in the distribution of users. We introduce the term auto-induced distributional shift (ADS) to describe the phenomenon of an algorithm causing a change in the distribution of its own inputs. Our goal is to ensure that machine learning systems do not leverage ADS to increase performance when doing so could be undesirable. We demonstrate that changes to the learning algorithm, such as the introduction of meta-learning, can cause hidden incentives for auto-induced distributional shift (HI-ADS) to be revealed. To address this issue, we introduce `unit tests' and a mitigation strategy for HI-ADS, as well as a toy environment for modelling real-world issues with HI-ADS in content recommendation, where we demonstrate that strong meta-learners achieve gains in performance via ADS.

Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) enables us to infer reward functions from demonstrations, but it usually assumes that the expert is noisily optimal. Real people, on the other hand, often have systematic biases: risk-aversion, myopia, etc. One option is to try to characterize these biases and account for them explicitly during learning. But in the era of deep learning, a natural suggestion researchers make is to avoid mathematical models of human behavior that are fraught with specific assumptions, and instead use a purely data-driven approach. We decided to put this to the test -- rather than relying on assumptions about which specific bias the demonstrator has when planning, we instead learn the demonstrator's planning algorithm that they use to generate demonstrations, as a differentiable planner. Our exploration yielded mixed findings: on the one hand, learning the planner can lead to better reward inference than relying on the wrong assumption; on the other hand, this benefit is dwarfed by the loss we incur by going from an exact to a differentiable planner. This suggest that at least for the foreseeable future, agents need a middle ground between the flexibility of data-driven methods and the useful bias of known human biases.

Inevitably, agents encounter new scenarios (e.g., new types of terrain) where optimizing that same reward may lead to undesired behavior. Our insight is that reward functions are merely observations about what the designer actually wants, and that they should be interpreted in the context in which they were designed. We introduce inverse reward design (IRD) as the problem of inferring the true objective based on the designed reward and the training MDP.

The learned transition model employs an abstract, discrete (bottleneck) state, which increases sample efficiency by reducing the number of model parameters and by exploiting structural properties of the environment. We provide a mathematical analysis of the Bottleneck Simulator in terms of fixed points of the learned policy, which reveals how performance is affected by four distinct sources of error: an error related to the abstract space structure, an error related to the transition model estimation variance, an error related to the transition model estimation bias, and an error related to the transition model class bias.

To leverage planning in unknown environments, the agent needs to learn the dynamics from interactions with the world. However, learning dynamics models that are accurate enough for planning has been a long-standing challenge, especially in image-based domains. We propose the Deep Planning Network (PlaNet), a purely model-based agent that learns the environment dynamics from images and chooses actions through fast online planning in latent space. To achieve high performance, the dynamics model must accurately predict the rewards ahead for multiple time steps. We approach this using a latent dynamics model with both deterministic and stochastic transition components. Moreover, we propose a multi-step variational inference objective that we name latent overshooting. Using only pixel observations, our agent solves continuous control tasks with contact dynamics, partial observability, and sparse rewards, which exceed the difficulty of tasks that were previously solved by planning with learned models.

The latter is trained with samples collected by the former, and generates rewards for the former when it fails to predict the actual action taken by the former. In such a competitive setting, the DRL agent learns to generate samples that the inverse dynamics model fails to predict correctly, while the inverse dynamics model learns to adapt to the challenging samples. We further propose a reward structure that ensures the DRL agent to collect only moderately hard samples but not overly hard ones that prevent the inverse model from predicting effectively.

However, we argue that this data, which is uninformative for one task, is likely a rich source of information for other tasks. To leverage this insight and efficiently reuse data, we present Generalized Hindsight: an approximate inverse reinforcement learning technique for relabeling behaviors with the right tasks. Intuitively, given a behavior generated under one task, Generalized Hindsight returns a different task that the behavior is better suited for. Then, the behavior is relabeled with this new task before being used by an off-policy RL optimizer.

In MDPs the Q-values are equal to the expected immediate reward plus the expected future rewards. The latter are related to bias problems in temporal difference (TD) learning and to high variance problems in Monte Carlo (MC) learning. Both problems are even more severe when rewards are delayed. RUDDER aims at making the expected future rewards zero, which simplifies Q-value estimation to computing the mean of the immediate reward. We propose the following two new concepts to push the expected future rewards toward zero. (i) Reward redistribution that leads to return-equivalent decision processes with the same optimal policies and, when optimal, zero expected future rewards. (ii) Return decomposition via contribution analysis which transforms the reinforcement learning task into a regression task at which deep learning excels. On artificial tasks with delayed rewards, RUDDER is significantly faster than MC and exponentially faster than Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), TD({\lambda}), and reward shaping approaches.

The reasons for this remain unclear. When using standard supervised methods (e.g., for bandits), on-policy data collection provides ""hard negatives"" that correct the model in precisely those states and actions that the policy is likely to visit. We call this phenomenon ""corrective feedback."" We show that bootstrapping-based Q-learning algorithms do not necessarily benefit from this corrective feedback, and training on the experience collected by the algorithm is not sufficient to correct errors in the Q-function. In fact, Q-learning and related methods can exhibit pathological interactions between the distribution of experience collected by the agent and the policy induced by training on that experience, leading to potential instability, sub-optimal convergence, and poor results when learning from noisy, sparse or delayed rewards. We demonstrate the existence of this problem, both theoretically and empirically. We then show that a specific correction to the data distribution can mitigate this issue. Based on these observations, we propose a new algorithm, DisCor, which computes an approximation to this optimal distribution and uses it to re-weight the transitions used for training, resulting in substantial improvements in a range of challenging RL settings, such as multi-task learning and learning from noisy reward signals.

However, we can also view RL as a generic sequence modeling problem, with the goal being to produce a sequence of actions that leads to a sequence of high rewards. Viewed in this way, it is tempting to consider whether high-capacity sequence prediction models that work well in other domains, such as natural-language processing, can also provide effective solutions to the RL problem. To this end, we explore how RL can be tackled with the tools of sequence modeling, using a Transformer architecture to model distributions over trajectories and repurposing beam search as a planning algorithm. Framing RL as sequence modeling problem simplifies a range of design decisions, allowing us to dispense with many of the components common in offline RL algorithms. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach across long-horizon dynamics prediction, imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and offline RL.

When RL models overfit, even slight modifications to the environment can result in poor agent performance. This paper explores how procedurally generated levels during training can increase generality. We show that for some games procedural level generation enables generalization to new levels within the same distribution. Additionally, it is possible to achieve better performance with less data by manipulating the difficulty of the levels in response to the performance of the agent. The generality of the learned behaviors is also evaluated on a set of human-designed levels. The results suggest that the ability to generalize to human-designed levels highly depends on the design of the level generators.

In this paper, we study two variants of pointwise robustness, the maximum safe radius problem, which for a given input sample computes the minimum distance to an adversarial example, and the feature robustness problem, which aims to quantify the robustness of individual features to adversarial perturbations. We demonstrate that, under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity, both problems can be approximated using finite optimisation by discretising the input space, and the approximation has provable guarantees, i.e., the error is bounded. We then show that the resulting optimisation problems can be reduced to the solution of two-player turn-based games, where the first player selects features and the second perturbs the image within the feature. While the second player aims to minimise the distance to an adversarial example, depending on the optimisation objective the first player can be cooperative or competitive. We employ an anytime approach to solve the games, in the sense of approximating the value of a game by monotonically improving its upper and lower bounds. The Monte Carlo tree search algorithm is applied to compute upper bounds for both games, and the Admissible A* and the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms are, respectively, used to compute lower bounds for the maximum safety radius and feature robustness games. When working on the upper bound of the maximum safe radius problem, our tool demonstrates competitive performance against existing adversarial example crafting algorithms.

The most promising defenses, adversarially robust training and verifiably robust training, have limitations that restrict their practical applications. The adversarially robust training only makes the networks robust against a subclass of attackers and we reveal such weaknesses by developing a new attack based on interval gradients. By contrast, verifiably robust training provides protection against any L-p norm-bounded attacker but incurs orders of magnitude more computational and memory overhead than adversarially robust training. We propose two novel techniques, stochastic robust approximation and dynamic mixed training, to drastically improve the efficiency of verifiably robust training without sacrificing verified robustness. We leverage two critical insights: (1) instead of over the entire training set, sound over-approximations over randomly subsampled training data points are sufficient for efficiently guiding the robust training process; and (2) We observe that the test accuracy and verifiable robustness often conflict after certain training epochs. Therefore, we use a dynamic loss function to adaptively balance them for each epoch. We designed and implemented our techniques as part of MixTrain and evaluated it on six networks trained on three popular datasets including MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet-200. Our evaluations show that MixTrain can achieve up to $95.2\%$ verified robust accuracy against $L_\infty$ norm-bounded attackers while taking $15$ and $3$ times less training time than state-of-the-art verifiably robust training and adversarially robust training schemes, respectively.

Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst-case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations.

Through a comprehensive analysis, we show how a simple bounding technique, interval bound propagation (IBP), can be exploited to train large provably robust neural networks that beat the state-of-the-art in verified accuracy.

Both networks can be trained simultaneously to optimize a weighted combination of the standard data-fitting loss and a term that bounds the maximum violation of the property.

However, networks trained only to optimize for training accuracy can often be fooled by adversarial examples - slightly perturbed inputs that are misclassified with high confidence. Verification of networks enables us to gauge their vulnerability to such adversarial examples. We formulate verification of piecewise-linear neural networks as a mixed integer program. On a representative task of finding minimum adversarial distortions, our verifier is two to three orders of magnitude quicker than the state-of-the-art. We achieve this computational speedup via tight formulations for non-linearities, as well as a novel presolve algorithm that makes full use of all information available. The computational speedup allows us to verify properties on convolutional networks with an order of magnitude more ReLUs than networks previously verified by any complete verifier. In particular, we determine for the first time the exact adversarial accuracy of an MNIST classifier to perturbations with bounded $l_\infty$ norm $\epsilon=0.1$: for this classifier, we find an adversarial example for 4.38% of samples, and a certificate of robustness (to perturbations with bounded norm) for the remainder.

Specifically, our method simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or views) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly as in contrastive learning. Simply put, we use a swapped prediction mechanism where we predict the cluster assignment of a view from the representation of another view. Our method can be trained with large and small batches and can scale to unlimited amounts of data. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method is more memory efficient since it does not require a large memory bank or a special momentum network.

Although this paradigm uses unlabeled data in a task-agnostic way, in contrast to common approaches to semi-supervised learning for computer vision, we show that it is surprisingly effective for semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A key ingredient of our approach is the use of big (deep and wide) networks during pretraining and fine-tuning. We find that, the fewer the labels, the more this approach (task-agnostic use of unlabeled data) benefits from a bigger network. After fine-tuning, the big network can be further improved and distilled into a much smaller one with little loss in classification accuracy by using the unlabeled examples for a second time, but in a task-specific way. The proposed semi-supervised learning algorithm can be summarized in three steps: unsupervised pretraining of a big ResNet model using SimCLRv2, supervised fine-tuning on a few labeled examples, and distillation with unlabeled examples for refining and transferring the task-specific knowledge.

To verify this hypothesis, we devise unsupervised and semi-supervised frameworks that learn effective views by aiming to reduce their MI. We also consider data augmentation as a way to reduce MI, and show that increasing data augmentation indeed leads to decreasing MI and improves downstream classification accuracy.

We show that such algorithms are possible via Generative Teaching Networks (GTNs), a general approach that is, in theory, applicable to supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, although our experiments only focus on the supervised case. GTNs are deep neural networks that generate data and/or training environments that a learner (e.g. a freshly initialized neural network) trains on for a few SGD steps before being tested on a target task. We then differentiate through the entire learning process via meta-gradients to update the GTN parameters to improve performance on the target task. GTNs have the beneficial property that they can theoretically generate any type of data or training environment, making their potential impact large. This paper introduces GTNs, discusses their potential, and showcases that they can substantially accelerate learning. We also demonstrate a practical and exciting application of GTNs: accelerating the evaluation of candidate architectures for neural architecture search (NAS), which is rate-limited by such evaluations, enabling massive speed-ups in NAS. GTN-NAS improves the NAS state of the art, finding higher performing architectures when controlling for the search proposal mechanism. GTN-NAS also is competitive with the overall state of the art approaches, which achieve top performance while using orders of magnitude less computation than typical NAS methods. Speculating forward, GTNs may represent a first step toward the ambitious goal of algorithms that generate their own training data and, in doing so, open a variety of interesting new research questions and directions.",2019-12-16,2022-03-10 23:30:44,2022-03-10 23:30:44,2022-03-10 23:30:44,,,,,,,Generative Teaching Networks,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1912.07768,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/4L34H87B/Such et al. - 2019 - Generative Teaching Networks Accelerating Neural .pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/4F4KFVMX/1912.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models.

A plethora of work has demonstrated that it is easy to find or synthesize inputs for which a neural network is highly confident yet wrong. Generative models are widely viewed to be robust to such mistaken confidence as modeling the density of the input features can be used to detect novel, out-of-distribution inputs. In this paper we challenge this assumption. We find that the density learned by flow-based models, VAEs, and PixelCNNs cannot distinguish images of common objects such as dogs, trucks, and horses (i.e. CIFAR-10) from those of house numbers (i.e. SVHN), assigning a higher likelihood to the latter when the model is trained on the former. Moreover, we find evidence of this phenomenon when pairing several popular image data sets: FashionMNIST vs MNIST, CelebA vs SVHN, ImageNet vs CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 / SVHN. To investigate this curious behavior, we focus analysis on flow-based generative models in particular since they are trained and evaluated via the exact marginal likelihood. We find such behavior persists even when we restrict the flows to constant-volume transformations. These transformations admit some theoretical analysis, and we show that the difference in likelihoods can be explained by the location and variances of the data and the model curvature. Our results caution against using the density estimates from deep generative models to identify inputs similar to the training distribution until their behavior for out-of-distribution inputs is better understood.",2019-02-24,2022-03-10 23:30:54,2022-03-10 23:30:54,2022-03-10 23:30:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1810.09136,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/WU6X5QAU/Nalisnick et al. - 2019 - Do Deep Generative Models Know What They Don't Kno.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/SC7UELE7/1810.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, subtle changes to the background or texture of an image can break a seemingly powerful classifier. Building on previous work on domain generalization, we hope to produce a classifier that will generalize to previously unseen domains, even when domain identifiers are not available during training. This setting is challenging because the model may extract many distribution-specific (superficial) signals together with distribution-agnostic (semantic) signals. To overcome this challenge, we incorporate the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to extract patterns that our prior knowledge suggests are superficial: they are sensitive to the texture but unable to capture the gestalt of an image. Then we introduce two techniques for improving our networks' out-of-sample performance. The first method is built on the reverse gradient method that pushes our model to learn representations from which the GLCM representation is not predictable. The second method is built on the independence introduced by projecting the model's representation onto the subspace orthogonal to GLCM representation's.

Sample re-weighting strategy is commonly used to alleviate this issue by designing a weighting function mapping from training loss to sample weight, and then iterating between weight recalculating and classifier updating. Current approaches, however, need manually pre-specify the weighting function as well as its additional hyper-parameters. It makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practice due to the significant variation of proper weighting schemes relying on the investigated problem and training data. To address this issue, we propose a method capable of adaptively learning an explicit weighting function directly from data. The weighting function is an MLP with one hidden layer, constituting a universal approximator to almost any continuous functions, making the method able to fit a wide range of weighting functions including those assumed in conventional research. Guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data, the parameters of the weighting function can be finely updated simultaneously with the learning process of the classifiers.

For instance, the observed reward channel is often subject to noise in practice (e.g., when rewards are collected through sensors), and is therefore not credible. In addition, for applications such as robotics, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm can be manipulated to produce arbitrary errors by receiving corrupted rewards. In this paper, we consider noisy RL problems with perturbed rewards, which can be approximated with a confusion matrix. We develop a robust RL framework that enables agents to learn in noisy environments where only perturbed rewards are observed. Our solution framework builds on existing RL/DRL algorithms and firstly addresses the biased noisy reward setting without any assumptions on the true distribution (e.g., zero-mean Gaussian noise as made in previous works). The core ideas of our solution include estimating a reward confusion matrix and defining a set of unbiased surrogate rewards. We prove the convergence and sample complexity of our approach. Extensive experiments on different DRL platforms show that trained policies based on our estimated surrogate reward can achieve higher expected rewards, and converge faster than existing baselines.

Our algorithm, Bayesian Policy Optimization, builds on recent policy optimization algorithms to learn a universal policy that navigates the exploration-exploitation trade-off to maximize the Bayesian value function.

We here put these conflicting hypotheses to a quantitative test by evaluating CNNs and human observers on images with a texture-shape cue conflict. We show that ImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and reveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate that the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based representation on ImageNet is able to learn a shape-based representation instead when trained on ""Stylized-ImageNet"", a stylized version of ImageNet. This provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our well-controlled psychophysical lab setting (nine experiments totalling 48,560 psychophysical trials across 97 observers) and comes with a number of unexpected emergent benefits such as improved object detection performance and previously unseen robustness towards a wide range of image distortions, highlighting advantages of a shape-based representation.",2019-01-14,2022-03-10 23:31:48,2022-03-10 23:31:48,2022-03-10 23:31:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1811.12231,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/XG9RN9SM/Geirhos et al. - 2019 - ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased towards texture; .pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/2P45AY2Z/1811.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Quantitative Biology - Neurons and Cognition; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Less surprisingly, image classifiers also lack human-level performance on randomly corrupted images, such as images with additive Gaussian noise. In this paper we provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that these are two manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon, establishing close connections between the adversarial robustness and corruption robustness research programs. This suggests that improving adversarial robustness should go hand in hand with improving performance in the presence of more general and realistic image corruptions.

Such neural networks in principle have the capacity to (over)fit any set of labels including pure noise. Despite this, somewhat paradoxically, neural network models trained via first-order methods continue to predict well on yet unseen test data. This paper takes a step towards demystifying this phenomena. Under a rich dataset model, we show that gradient descent is provably robust to noise/corruption on a constant fraction of the labels despite overparameterization. In particular, we prove that: (i) In the first few iterations where the updates are still in the vicinity of the initialization gradient descent only fits to the correct labels essentially ignoring the noisy labels. (ii) to start to overfit to the noisy labels network must stray rather far from from the initialization which can only occur after many more iterations. Together, these results show that gradient descent with early stopping is provably robust to label noise and shed light on the empirical robustness of deep networks as well as commonly adopted heuristics to prevent overfitting.",2019-07-03,2022-03-10 23:32:08,2022-03-10 23:32:08,2022-03-10 23:32:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1903.11680,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/L82S5IKG/Li et al. - 2019 - Gradient Descent with Early Stopping is Provably R.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/NU5BI2H5/1903.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the real world is very diverse, and human behavior often changes in response to agent deployment, the agent will likely encounter novel situations that have never been seen during training. This results in an evaluation challenge: if we cannot rely on the average training or validation reward as a metric, then how can we effectively evaluate robustness? We take inspiration from the practice of \emph{unit testing} in software engineering. Specifically, we suggest that when designing AI agents that collaborate with humans, designers should search for potential edge cases in \emph{possible partner behavior} and \emph{possible states encountered}, and write tests which check that the behavior of the agent in these edge cases is reasonable. We apply this methodology to build a suite of unit tests for the Overcooked-AI environment, and use this test suite to evaluate three proposals for improving robustness.

We hypothesize that these failures to robustly generalize are due to the learning systems retaining too much information about the training data. To test this hypothesis, we propose the Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) criterion for evaluating the quality of a model. In order to train models that perform well with respect to the MNI criterion, we present a new objective function, the Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB), which is closely related to the Information Bottleneck (IB).

This paper argues that neither of those criteria are certain of Deep Neural Networks. First, highly touted AI successes (eg. image classification and speech recognition) are orders of magnitude more failure-prone than are typically certified in critical systems even within design bounds (perfectly in-distribution sampling). Second, performance falls off only gradually as inputs become further Out-Of-Distribution (OOD).

An ML pipeline is underspecified when it can return many predictors with equivalently strong held-out performance in the training domain. Underspecification is common in modern ML pipelines, such as those based on deep learning. Predictors returned by underspecified pipelines are often treated as equivalent based on their training domain performance, but we show here that such predictors can behave very differently in deployment domains. This ambiguity can lead to instability and poor model behavior in practice, and is a distinct failure mode from previously identified issues arising from structural mismatch between training and deployment domains. We show that this problem appears in a wide variety of practical ML pipelines, using examples from computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, clinical risk prediction based on electronic health records, and medical genomics.

This behavior is not captured by classical generalization, which would only consider the average error and not the distribution of errors over the input domain. Our formal conjectures, which are much more general than this example, characterize the form of distributional generalization that can be expected in terms of problem parameters: model architecture, training procedure, number of samples, and data distribution.

Much work has been done in AI over the years at lower levels, but a big part of what has been missing involves the high level, abstract, general nature of intelligence. We address this gap by developing a model for general intelligence. To accomplish this, we focus on three basic aspects of intelligence. First, we must realize the general order and nature of intelligence at a high level. Second, we must come to know what these realizations mean with respect to the overall intelligence process. Third, we must describe these realizations as clearly as possible. We propose a hierarchical model to help capture and exploit the order within intelligence. The underlying order involves patterns of signals that become organized, stored and activated in space and time. These patterns can be described using a simple, general hierarchy, with physical signals at the lowest level, information in the middle, and abstract signal representations at the top. This high level perspective provides a big picture that literally helps us see the intelligence process, thereby enabling fundamental realizations, a better understanding and clear descriptions of the intelligence process.

We define a formal counterpart of physical and intentional stances within computational theory: a description of a system as either a device, or an agent, with the key difference being that `devices' are directly described in terms of an input-output mapping, while `agents' are described in terms of the function they optimise.

Due to the difficulty of creating white-box adversarial examples for discrete text input, most analyses of the robustness of NLP models have been done through black-box adversarial examples. We investigate adversarial examples for character-level neural machine translation (NMT), and contrast black-box adversaries with a novel white-box adversary, which employs differentiable string-edit operations to rank adversarial changes. We propose two novel types of attacks which aim to remove or change a word in a translation, rather than simply break the NMT. We demonstrate that white-box adversarial examples are significantly stronger than their black-box counterparts in different attack scenarios, which show more serious vulnerabilities than previously known.

First, we implement the state of the art version of adversarial training at unprecedented scale on ImageNet and investigate whether it remains effective in this setting - an important open scientific question (Athalye et al., 2018). Next, we introduce enhanced defenses using a technique we call logit pairing, a method that encourages logits for pairs of examples to be similar. When applied to clean examples and their adversarial counterparts, logit pairing improves accuracy on adversarial examples over vanilla adversarial training; we also find that logit pairing on clean examples only is competitive with adversarial training in terms of accuracy on two datasets. Finally, we show that adversarial logit pairing achieves the state of the art defense on ImageNet against PGD white box attacks, with an accuracy improvement from 1.5% to 27.9%. Adversarial logit pairing also successfully damages the current state of the art defense against black box attacks on ImageNet (Tramer et al., 2018), dropping its accuracy from 66.6% to 47.1%.

Because this noise is nearly imperceptible to human viewers, biological vision is assumed to be robust to adversarial attack. Despite this apparent difference in robustness, CNNs are currently the best models of biological vision, revealing a gap in explaining how the brain responds to adversarial images. Indeed, sensitivity to adversarial attack has not been measured for biological vision under normal conditions, nor have attack methods been specifically designed to affect biological vision. We studied the effects of adversarial attack on primate vision, measuring both monkey neuronal responses and human behavior. Adversarial images were created by modifying images from one category(such as human faces) to look like a target category(such as monkey faces), while limiting pixel value change. We tested three attack directions via several attack methods, including directly using CNN adversarial images and using a CNN-based predictive model to guide monkey visual neuron responses. We considered a wide range of image change magnitudes that covered attack success rates up to>90%. We found that adversarial images designed for CNNs were ineffective in attacking primate vision. Even when considering the best attack method, primate vision was more robust to adversarial attack than an ensemble of CNNs, requiring over 100-fold larger image change to attack successfully. The success of individual attack methods and images was correlated between monkey neurons and human behavior, but was less correlated between either and CNN categorization.

We introduce attacks that instead {\em reprogram} the target model to perform a task chosen by the attacker---without the attacker needing to specify or compute the desired output for each test-time input. This attack finds a single adversarial perturbation, that can be added to all test-time inputs to a machine learning model in order to cause the model to perform a task chosen by the adversary---even if the model was not trained to do this task. These perturbations can thus be considered a program for the new task.

Using a locally quadratic approximation, we provide theoretical evidence on the existence of a strong relation between large robustness and small curvature. To further show the importance of reduced curvature for improving the robustness, we propose a new regularizer that directly minimizes curvature of the loss surface, and leads to adversarial robustness that is on par with adversarial training.

In this work, we leverage quantitative perceptual metrics like LPIPS and SSIM to define a novel threat model for adversarial attacks. To demonstrate the value of quantifying the perceptual distortion of adversarial examples, we present and employ a unifying framework fusing different attack styles. We first prove that our framework results in images that are unattainable by attack styles in isolation. We then perform adversarial training using attacks generated by our framework to demonstrate that networks are only robust to classes of adversarial perturbations they have been trained against, and combination attacks are stronger than any of their individual components.

The existence of these errors raises a variety of questions about out-of-sample generalization and whether bad actors might use such examples to abuse deployed systems. As a result of these security concerns, there has been a flurry of recent papers proposing algorithms to defend against such malicious perturbations of correctly handled examples. It is unclear how such misclassifications represent a different kind of security problem than other errors, or even other attacker-produced examples that have no specific relationship to an uncorrupted input. In this paper, we argue that adversarial example defense papers have, to date, mostly considered abstract, toy games that do not relate to any specific security concern. Furthermore, defense papers have not yet precisely described all the abilities and limitations of attackers that would be relevant in practical security.

We show that even the widely recognized and by far most successful defense by Madry et al. (1) overfits on the L-infinity metric (it's highly susceptible to L2 and L0 perturbations), (2) classifies unrecognizable images with high certainty, (3) performs not much better than simple input binarization and (4) features adversarial perturbations that make little sense to humans. These results suggest that MNIST is far from being solved in terms of adversarial robustness. We present a novel robust classification model that performs analysis by synthesis using learned class-conditional data distributions. We derive bounds on the robustness and go to great length to empirically evaluate our model using maximally effective adversarial attacks by (a) applying decision-based, score-based, gradient-based and transfer-based attacks for several different Lp norms, (b) by designing a new attack that exploits the structure of our defended model and (c) by devising a novel decision-based attack that seeks to minimize the number of perturbed pixels (L0).

To create ImageNet-UA's diverse attack suite, we introduce a total of four novel adversarial attacks.

We demonstrate that by integrating this solver into end-to-end learning systems, we can learn the logical structure of challenging problems in a minimally supervised fashion.

Recent work calls this into question for neural networks and other over-parameterized models, for which it is often observed that larger models generalize better. We provide a simple explanation for this by measuring the bias and variance of neural networks: while the bias is monotonically decreasing as in the classical theory, the variance is unimodal or bell-shaped: it increases then decreases with the width of the network. We vary the network architecture, loss function, and choice of dataset and confirm that variance unimodality occurs robustly for all models we considered. The risk curve is the sum of the bias and variance curves and displays different qualitative shapes depending on the relative scale of bias and variance, with the double descent curve observed in recent literature as a special case. We corroborate these empirical results with a theoretical analysis of two-layer linear networks with random first layer.

We test two model selection criteria, cross-validation and minimum description length, for choosing LM prompts and hyperparameters in the true few-shot setting. On average, both marginally outperform random selection and greatly underperform selection based on held-out examples. Moreover, selection criteria often prefer models that perform significantly worse than randomly-selected ones.

Overall, our findings suggest that prior work significantly overestimated the true few-shot ability of LMs given the difficulty of few-shot model selection.",2021-05-24,2022-03-10 23:42:48,2022-03-10 23:42:48,2022-03-10 23:42:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2105.11447,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/2SNVCTPG/Perez et al. - 2021 - True Few-Shot Learning with Language Models.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/GILNT25Q/2105.html,,,Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluate a collection of such models (with between 244M and 137B parameters) on two new benchmarks, MBPP and MathQA-Python, in both the few-shot and fine-tuning regimes. Our benchmarks are designed to measure the ability of these models to synthesize short Python programs from natural language descriptions. The Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP) dataset contains 974 programming tasks, designed to be solvable by entry-level programmers. The MathQA-Python dataset, a Python version of the MathQA benchmark, contains 23914 problems that evaluate the ability of the models to synthesize code from more complex text. On both datasets, we find that synthesis performance scales log-linearly with model size. Our largest models, even without finetuning on a code dataset, can synthesize solutions to 59.6 percent of the problems from MBPP using few-shot learning with a well-designed prompt. Fine-tuning on a held-out portion of the dataset improves performance by about 10 percentage points across most model sizes. On the MathQA-Python dataset, the largest fine-tuned model achieves 83.8 percent accuracy. Going further, we study the model's ability to engage in dialog about code, incorporating human feedback to improve its solutions. We find that natural language feedback from a human halves the error rate compared to the model's initial prediction. Additionally, we conduct an error analysis to shed light on where these models fall short and what types of programs are most difficult to generate. Finally, we explore the semantic grounding of these models by fine-tuning them to predict the results of program execution. We find that even our best models are generally unable to predict the output of a program given a specific input.",2021-08-15,2022-03-10 23:42:57,2022-03-10 23:42:57,2022-03-10 23:42:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2108.07732,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/HT3SYX4A/Austin et al. - 2021 - Program Synthesis with Large Language Models.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/EXGXSEVP/2108.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Programming Languages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rapid changes in these everyday work and entertainment tools have fueled a rising interest in the underlying technology itself; journalists write about AI tirelessly, and companies -- of tech nature or not -- brand themselves with AI, Machine Learning or Deep Learning whenever they get a chance. Confronting squarely this media coverage, several analysts are starting to voice concerns about over-interpretation of AI's blazing successes and the sometimes poor public reporting on the topic.

Our results suggest that diversity in AI research has stagnated in recent years, and that AI research involving the private sector tends to be less diverse and more influential than research in academia. We also find that private sector AI researchers tend to specialise in data-hungry and computationally intensive deep learning methods at the expense of research involving other AI methods, research that considers the societal and ethical implications of AI, and applications in sectors like health.

There is a growing divide in approaches to building systems: on the one hand, programming leverages human experts to define a system while on the other hand behavior is learned from data in machine learning. We propose to hybridize these two by providing a 3-call API which we expose through an object called SmartChoice. We describe the SmartChoices-interface, how it can be used in programming with minimal code changes, and demonstrate that it is an easy to use but still powerful tool by demonstrating improvements over not using ML at all on three algorithmic problems: binary search, QuickSort, and caches. In these three examples, we replace the commonly used heuristics with an ML model entirely encapsulated within a SmartChoice and thus requiring minimal code changes. As opposed to previous work applying ML to algorithmic problems, our proposed approach does not require to drop existing implementations but seamlessly integrates into the standard software development workflow and gives full control to the software developer over how ML methods are applied. Our implementation relies on standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. To learn faster, we use the heuristic function, which they are replacing, as an initial function. We show how this initial function can be used to speed up and stabilize learning while providing a safety net that prevents performance to become substantially worse -- allowing for a safe deployment in critical applications in real life.",2019-06-13,2022-03-10 23:43:26,2022-03-10 23:43:26,2022-03-10 23:43:25,,,,,,,SmartChoices,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1810.00619,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/GGXH2H3R/Carbune et al. - 2019 - SmartChoices Hybridizing Programming and Machine .pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/B67S53QR/1810.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Programming Languages; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are not arguing for any specific approach on when or how research should be distributed, but instead try to lay out some useful tools, analogies, and options for thinking about these issues. We begin with some background on the idea that ML research might be misused in harmful ways, and why advances in synthetic media, in particular, are raising concerns. We then outline in more detail some of the different paths to harm from ML research, before reviewing research risk mitigation strategies in other fields and identifying components that seem most worth emulating in the ML and synthetic media research communities. Next, we outline some important dimensions of disagreement on these issues which risk polarizing conversations. Finally, we conclude with recommendations, suggesting that the machine learning community might benefit from: working with subject matter experts to increase understanding of the risk landscape and possible mitigation strategies; building a community and norms around understanding the impacts of ML research, e.g. through regular workshops at major conferences; and establishing institutions and systems to support release practices that would otherwise be onerous and error-prone.",2019-07-28,2022-03-10 23:44:01,2022-03-10 23:44:01,2022-03-10 23:44:01,,,,,,,Reducing malicious use of synthetic media research,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1907.11274,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/PJEWY7UN/Ovadya and Whittlestone - 2019 - Reducing malicious use of synthetic media research.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BPNB88MY/1907.html,,,Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, these relationships are more nuanced than that: hardware shapes the methods used by researchers and engineers in the design and development of machine learning models. Characteristics such as the power consumption of chips also define where and how machine learning can be used in the real world. Despite this, many analyses of the social impact of the current wave of progress in AI have not substantively brought the dimension of hardware into their accounts. While a common trope in both the popular press and scholarly literature is to highlight the massive increase in computational power that has enabled the recent breakthroughs in machine learning, the analysis frequently goes no further than this observation around magnitude.

While applications like summarization and translation are positive, the underlying technology also might enable adversaries to generate neural fake news: targeted propaganda that closely mimics the style of real news. Modern computer security relies on careful threat modeling: identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities from an adversary's point of view, and exploring potential mitigations to these threats. Likewise, developing robust defenses against neural fake news requires us first to carefully investigate and characterize the risks of these models. We thus present a model for controllable text generation called Grover. Given a headline like `Link Found Between Vaccines and Autism,' Grover can generate the rest of the article; humans find these generations to be more trustworthy than human-written disinformation. Developing robust verification techniques against generators like Grover is critical. We find that best current discriminators can classify neural fake news from real, human-written, news with 73% accuracy, assuming access to a moderate level of training data. Counterintuitively, the best defense against Grover turns out to be Grover itself, with 92% accuracy, demonstrating the importance of public release of strong generators. We investigate these results further, showing that exposure bias -- and sampling strategies that alleviate its effects -- both leave artifacts that similar discriminators can pick up on.

We find that this intuition is only partially correct: data efficiency makes it easier to create ML applications, but large AI firms may have more to gain from higher performing AI systems. Further, we find that the effect on privacy, data markets, robustness, and misuse are complex. For example, while it seems intuitive that misuse risk would increase along with data efficiency -- as more actors gain access to any level of capability -- the net effect crucially depends on how much defensive measures are improved. More investigation into data efficiency, as well as research into the ""AI production function"", will be key to understanding the development of the AI industry and its societal impacts.",2020-02-07,2022-03-10 23:44:19,2022-03-10 23:44:19,2022-03-10 23:44:19,378-384,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2001.05068,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/D82TK4WV/Tucker et al. - 2020 - Social and Governance Implications of Improved Dat.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/XAXBBTL2/2001.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computers and Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By comparing the well-studied actions of another industry (Big Tobacco) to the current actions of Big Tech we see similar strategies employed by both industries. These strategies enable either industry to sway and influence academic and public discourse. We examine the funding of academic research as a tool used by Big Tech to put forward a socially responsible public image, influence events hosted by and decisions made by funded universities, influence the research questions and plans of individual scientists, and discover receptive academics who can be leveraged. We demonstrate how Big Tech can affect academia from the institutional level down to individual researchers.

While lying has traditionally been a human affair, AI systems that make sophisticated verbal statements are becoming increasingly prevalent. This raises the question of how we should limit the harm caused by AI ""lies"" (i.e. falsehoods that are actively selected for). Human truthfulness is governed by social norms and by laws (against defamation, perjury, and fraud). Differences between AI and humans present an opportunity to have more precise standards of truthfulness for AI, and to have these standards rise over time. This could provide significant benefits to public epistemics and the economy, and mitigate risks of worst-case AI futures. Establishing norms or laws of AI truthfulness will require significant work to: (1) identify clear truthfulness standards; (2) create institutions that can judge adherence to those standards; and (3) develop AI systems that are robustly truthful. Our initial proposals for these areas include: (1) a standard of avoiding ""negligent falsehoods"" (a generalisation of lies that is easier to assess); (2) institutions to evaluate AI systems before and after real-world deployment; and (3) explicitly training AI systems to be truthful via curated datasets and human interaction. A concerning possibility is that evaluation mechanisms for eventual truthfulness standards could be captured by political interests, leading to harmful censorship and propaganda. Avoiding this might take careful attention. And since the scale of AI speech acts might grow dramatically over the coming decades, early truthfulness standards might be particularly important because of the precedents they set.",2021-10-13,2022-03-10 23:44:22,2022-03-10 23:44:22,2022-03-10 23:44:21,,,,,,,Truthful AI,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2110.06674,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BIY2B2AL/Evans et al. - 2021 - Truthful AI Developing and governing AI that does.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/RSAQUYYN/2110.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Computers and Society; I.2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Publishing scientific research can facilitate misuse of the technology, but the research can also contribute to protections against misuse. This paper addresses the balance between these two effects. Our theoretical framework elucidates the factors governing whether the published research will be more useful for attackers or defenders, such as the possibility for adequate defensive measures, or the independent discovery of the knowledge outside of the scientific community. The balance will vary across scientific fields. However, we show that the existing conversation within AI has imported concepts and conclusions from prior debates within computer security over the disclosure of software vulnerabilities.

We propose a theory that explains and connects these scaling laws. We identify variance-limited and resolution-limited scaling behavior for both dataset and model size, for a total of four scaling regimes. The variance-limited scaling follows simply from the existence of a well-behaved infinite data or infinite width limit, while the resolution-limited regime can be explained by positing that models are effectively resolving a smooth data manifold. In the large width limit, this can be equivalently obtained from the spectrum of certain kernels, and we present evidence that large width and large dataset resolution-limited scaling exponents are related by a duality. We exhibit all four scaling regimes in the controlled setting of large random feature and pretrained models and test the predictions empirically on a range of standard architectures and datasets.

This simple theory predicts that the scaling exponents $\alpha \approx 4/d$ for cross-entropy and mean-squared error losses. We confirm the theory by independently measuring the intrinsic dimension and the scaling exponents in a teacher/student framework, where we can study a variety of $d$ and $\alpha$ by dialing the properties of random teacher networks.

Experiments show that NALU-enhanced neural networks can learn to track time, perform arithmetic over images of numbers, translate numerical language into real-valued scalars, execute computer code, and count objects in images.

Often, the forward process from parameter- to measurement-space is a well-defined function, whereas the inverse problem is ambiguous: one measurement may map to multiple different sets of parameters. In this setting, the posterior parameter distribution, conditioned on an input measurement, has to be determined. We argue that a particular class of neural networks is well suited for this task -- so-called Invertible Neural Networks (INNs). Although INNs are not new, they have, so far, received little attention in literature. While classical neural networks attempt to solve the ambiguous inverse problem directly, INNs are able to learn it jointly with the well-defined forward process, using additional latent output variables to capture the information otherwise lost. Given a specific measurement and sampled latent variables, the inverse pass of the INN provides a full distribution over parameter space.

However, due to increased test-time cost (for ensembles) and increased complexity of the training pipeline (for distillation), these techniques are challenging to use in industrial settings. In this paper we explore a variant of distillation which is relatively straightforward to use as it does not require a complicated multi-stage setup or many new hyperparameters. Our first claim is that online distillation enables us to use extra parallelism to fit very large datasets about twice as fast. Crucially, we can still speed up training even after we have already reached the point at which additional parallelism provides no benefit for synchronous or asynchronous stochastic gradient descent. Two neural networks trained on disjoint subsets of the data can share knowledge by encouraging each model to agree with the predictions the other model would have made. These predictions can come from a stale version of the other model so they can be safely computed using weights that only rarely get transmitted. Our second claim is that online distillation is a cost-effective way to make the exact predictions of a model dramatically more reproducible.

We show how to construct scalable best-response approximations for neural networks by modeling the best-response as a single network whose hidden units are gated conditionally on the regularizer. We justify this approximation by showing the exact best-response for a shallow linear network with L2-regularized Jacobian can be represented by a similar gating mechanism. We fit this model using a gradient-based hyperparameter optimization algorithm which alternates between approximating the best-response around the current hyperparameters and optimizing the hyperparameters using the approximate best-response function. Unlike other gradient-based approaches, we do not require differentiating the training loss with respect to the hyperparameters, allowing us to tune discrete hyperparameters, data augmentation hyperparameters, and dropout probabilities. Because the hyperparameters are adapted online, our approach discovers hyperparameter schedules that can outperform fixed hyperparameter values.

We study the learning dynamics of reinforcement learning (RL), specifically a characteristic coupling between learning and data generation that arises because RL agents control their future data distribution. In the presence of function approximation, this coupling can lead to a problematic type of 'ray interference', characterized by learning dynamics that sequentially traverse a number of performance plateaus, effectively constraining the agent to learn one thing at a time even when learning in parallel is better. We establish the conditions under which ray interference occurs, show its relation to saddle points and obtain the exact learning dynamics in a restricted setting.

In particular, models based on recurrent neural networks and on reinforcement learning depend on recurrence relations, data-dependent conditional execution, and other features that call for dynamic control flow. These applications benefit from the ability to make rapid control-flow decisions across a set of computing devices in a distributed system. For performance, scalability, and expressiveness, a machine learning system must support dynamic control flow in distributed and heterogeneous environments. This paper presents a programming model for distributed machine learning that supports dynamic control flow. We describe the design of the programming model, and its implementation in TensorFlow, a distributed machine learning system. Our approach extends the use of dataflow graphs to represent machine learning models, offering several distinctive features. First, the branches of conditionals and bodies of loops can be partitioned across many machines to run on a set of heterogeneous devices, including CPUs, GPUs, and custom ASICs. Second, programs written in our model support automatic differentiation and distributed gradient computations, which are necessary for training machine learning models that use control flow. Third, our choice of non-strict semantics enables multiple loop iterations to execute in parallel across machines, and to overlap compute and I/O operations.

We propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance.

However, this hypothesis has never been systematically tested. Here, we compare the performance of 16 classification networks on 12 image classification datasets. We find that, when networks are used as fixed feature extractors or fine-tuned, there is a strong correlation between ImageNet accuracy and transfer accuracy ($r = 0.99$ and $0.96$, respectively). In the former setting, we find that this relationship is very sensitive to the way in which networks are trained on ImageNet; many common forms of regularization slightly improve ImageNet accuracy but yield penultimate layer features that are much worse for transfer learning. Additionally, we find that, on two small fine-grained image classification datasets, pretraining on ImageNet provides minimal benefits, indicating the learned features from ImageNet do not transfer well to fine-grained tasks.

Our goal is to show that AutoML can go further: it is possible today to automatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical operations as building blocks. We demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that significantly reduces human bias through a generic search space. Despite the vastness of this space, evolutionary search can still discover two-layer neural networks trained by backpropagation. These simple neural networks can then be surpassed by evolving directly on tasks of interest, e.g. CIFAR-10 variants, where modern techniques emerge in the top algorithms, such as bilinear interactions, normalized gradients, and weight averaging. Moreover, evolution adapts algorithms to different task types: e.g., dropout-like techniques appear when little data is available.

In this work, we study how agents can autonomously explore realistic and complex 3D environments without the context of task-rewards. We propose a learning-based approach and investigate different policy architectures, reward functions, and training paradigms. We find that the use of policies with spatial memory that are bootstrapped with imitation learning and finally finetuned with coverage rewards derived purely from on-board sensors can be effective at exploring novel environments. We show that our learned exploration policies can explore better than classical approaches based on geometry alone and generic learning-based exploration techniques.

We present Plan2Explore, a self-supervised reinforcement learning agent that tackles both these challenges through a new approach to self-supervised exploration and fast adaptation to new tasks, which need not be known during exploration. During exploration, unlike prior methods which retrospectively compute the novelty of observations after the agent has already reached them, our agent acts efficiently by leveraging planning to seek out expected future novelty. After exploration, the agent quickly adapts to multiple downstream tasks in a zero or a few-shot manner. We evaluate on challenging control tasks from high-dimensional image inputs. Without any training supervision or task-specific interaction, Plan2Explore outperforms prior self-supervised exploration methods, and in fact, almost matches the performances oracle which has access to rewards.

Typically, this involves minimizing a surrogate objective, such as the negative log likelihood of a generative model, with the hope that representations useful for subsequent tasks will arise as a side effect. In this work, we propose instead to directly target later desired tasks by meta-learning an unsupervised learning rule which leads to representations useful for those tasks. Specifically, we target semi-supervised classification performance, and we meta-learn an algorithm -- an unsupervised weight update rule -- that produces representations useful for this task. Additionally, we constrain our unsupervised update rule to a be a biologically-motivated, neuron-local function, which enables it to generalize to different neural network architectures, datasets, and data modalities. We show that the meta-learned update rule produces useful features and sometimes outperforms existing unsupervised learning techniques. We further show that the meta-learned unsupervised update rule generalizes to train networks with different widths, depths, and nonlinearities.

A new architecture recently introduced by Sabour et al., referred to as a capsule networks with dynamic routing, has shown great initial results for digit recognition and small image classification. The success of capsule networks lies in their ability to preserve more information about the input by replacing max-pooling layers with convolutional strides and dynamic routing, allowing for preservation of part-whole relationships in the data. This preservation of the input is demonstrated by reconstructing the input from the output capsule vectors. Our work expands the use of capsule networks to the task of object segmentation for the first time in the literature. We extend the idea of convolutional capsules with locally-connected routing and propose the concept of deconvolutional capsules. Further, we extend the masked reconstruction to reconstruct the positive input class. The proposed convolutional-deconvolutional capsule network, called SegCaps, shows strong results for the task of object segmentation with substantial decrease in parameter space. As an example application, we applied the proposed SegCaps to segment pathological lungs from low dose CT scans and compared its accuracy and efficiency with other U-Net-based architectures. SegCaps is able to handle large image sizes (512 x 512) as opposed to baseline capsules (typically less than 32 x 32).

Several recent results have explored the possibility of pruning at initialization time to provide similar benefits during training. In particular, the ""lottery ticket hypothesis"" conjectures that typical neural networks contain small subnetworks that can train to similar accuracy in a commensurate number of steps. The evidence for this claim is that a procedure based on iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) reliably finds such subnetworks retroactively on small vision tasks. However, IMP fails on deeper networks, and proposed methods to prune before training or train pruned networks encounter similar scaling limitations. In this paper, we argue that these efforts have struggled on deeper networks because they have focused on pruning precisely at initialization. We modify IMP to search for subnetworks that could have been obtained by pruning early in training (0.1% to 7% through) rather than at iteration 0. With this change, it finds small subnetworks of deeper networks (e.g., 80% sparsity on Resnet-50) that can complete the training process to match the accuracy of the original network on more challenging tasks (e.g., ImageNet). In situations where IMP fails at iteration 0, the accuracy benefits of delaying pruning accrue rapidly over the earliest iterations of training. To explain these behaviors, we study subnetwork ""stability,"" finding that - as accuracy improves in this fashion - IMP subnetworks train to parameters closer to those of the full network and do so with improved consistency in the face of gradient noise. These results offer new insights into the opportunity to prune large-scale networks early in training and the behaviors underlying the lottery ticket hypothesis",2020-07-20,2022-03-10 23:52:21,2022-03-10 23:52:21,2022-03-10 23:52:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1903.01611,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/4JD2525V/Frankle et al. - 2020 - Stabilizing the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/4PMYLKYB/1903.html,,,Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The network is designed using a loss function that can be optimized with either gradient-based or non-gradient-based methods. We also describe a method we call regeneration to train the network without explicit optimization, by injecting the network with predictions of its own parameters. The best solution for a self-replicating network was found by alternating between regeneration and optimization steps. Finally, we describe a design for a self-replicating neural network that can solve an auxiliary task such as MNIST image classification. We observe that there is a trade-off between the network's ability to classify images and its ability to replicate, but training is biased towards increasing its specialization at image classification at the expense of replication. This is analogous to the trade-off between reproduction and other tasks observed in nature.

Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias-variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in the modern machine learning practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model should balance under-fitting and over-fitting: rich enough to express underlying structure in data, simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in the modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered over-fit, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This ""double descent"" curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence.

Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3's ""few-shot"" learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method ""closes the gap"" and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant in that large models are costly to share and serve, and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed ""prefix tuning"" of Li and Liang (2021), and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches.

However, their inherently sequential computation makes them slow to train. Feed-forward and convolutional architectures have recently been shown to achieve superior results on some sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, with the added advantage that they concurrently process all inputs in the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster training times. Despite these successes, however, popular feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer fail to generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent models handle with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical inference when the string or formula lengths exceed those observed at training time. We propose the Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses these issues. UTs combine the parallelizability and global receptive field of feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs. We also add a dynamic per-position halting mechanism and find that it improves accuracy on several tasks. In contrast to the standard Transformer, under certain assumptions, UTs can be shown to be Turing-complete. Our experiments show that UTs outperform standard Transformers on a wide range of algorithmic and language understanding tasks, including the challenging LAMBADA language modeling task where UTs achieve a new state of the art, and machine translation where UTs achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over Transformers on the WMT14 En-De dataset.",2019-03-05,2022-03-10 23:53:17,2022-03-10 23:53:17,2022-03-10 23:53:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1807.03819,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/E8IN3VJC/Dehghani et al. - 2019 - Universal Transformers.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/UV9M5L4W/1807.html,,,Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We consider the problem of an agent learning a policy for a coordination game in a simulated environment and then using this policy when it enters an existing group. When there are multiple possible conventions we show that learning a policy via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is likely to find policies which achieve high payoffs at training time but fail to coordinate with the real group into which the agent enters. We assume access to a small number of samples of behavior from the true convention and show that we can augment the MARL objective to help it find policies consistent with the real group's convention. In three environments from the literature - traffic, communication, and team coordination - we observe that augmenting MARL with a small amount of imitation learning greatly increases the probability that the strategy found by MARL fits well with the existing social convention.

Unfortunately, most standard multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques, such as self-play (SP) or population play (PP), produce agents that overfit to their training partners and do not generalize well to humans. Alternatively, researchers can collect human data, train a human model using behavioral cloning, and then use that model to train ""human-aware"" agents (""behavioral cloning play"", or BCP). While such an approach can improve the generalization of agents to new human co-players, it involves the onerous and expensive step of collecting large amounts of human data first. Here, we study the problem of how to train agents that collaborate well with human partners without using human data. We argue that the crux of the problem is to produce a diverse set of training partners. Drawing inspiration from successful multi-agent approaches in competitive domains, we find that a surprisingly simple approach is highly effective. We train our agent partner as the best response to a population of self-play agents and their past checkpoints taken throughout training, a method we call Fictitious Co-Play (FCP).

But human laws and norms are complex and culturally varied systems, in many cases agents will have to learn the rules. This requires autonomous agents to have models of how human rule systems work so that they can make reliable predictions about rules. In this paper we contribute to the building of such models by analyzing an overlooked distinction between important rules and what we call silly rules--rules with no discernible direct impact on welfare. We show that silly rules render a normative system both more robust and more adaptable in response to shocks to perceived stability. They make normativity more legible for humans, and can increase legibility for AI systems as well. For AI systems to integrate into human normative systems, we suggest, it may be important for them to have models that include representations of silly rules.",2018-11-03,2022-03-10 23:55:51,2022-03-10 23:55:51,2022-03-10 23:55:51,,,,,,,Legible Normativity for AI Alignment,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1811.01267,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/STP5MYTC/Hadfield-Menell et al. - 2018 - Legible Normativity for AI Alignment The Value of.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/TJNA8KPW/1811.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all cases autoregressive Transformers smoothly improve in performance as model size and compute budgets increase, following a power-law plus constant scaling law. The optimal model size also depends on the compute budget through a power-law, with exponents that are nearly universal across all data domains. The cross-entropy loss has an information theoretic interpretation as $S($True$) + D_{\mathrm{KL}}($True$||$Model$)$, and the empirical scaling laws suggest a prediction for both the true data distribution's entropy and the KL divergence between the true and model distributions. With this interpretation, billion-parameter Transformers are nearly perfect models of the YFCC100M image distribution downsampled to an $8\times 8$ resolution, and we can forecast the model size needed to achieve any given reducible loss (ie $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$) in nats/image for other resolutions. We find a number of additional scaling laws in specific domains: (a) we identify a scaling relation for the mutual information between captions and images in multimodal models, and show how to answer the question ""Is a picture worth a thousand words?""; (b) in the case of mathematical problem solving, we identify scaling laws for model performance when extrapolating beyond the training distribution; (c) we finetune generative image models for ImageNet classification and find smooth scaling of the classification loss and error rate, even as the generative loss levels off.

In this paper, we formulate a regularization loss based on mutual information between feature embedding and bias. Based on the idea of minimizing this mutual information, we propose an iterative algorithm to unlearn the bias information. We employ an additional network to predict the bias distribution and train the network adversarially against the feature embedding network.

Despite the fact that we only observe the biased labels, we are able to show that the bias may nevertheless be corrected by re-weighting the data points without changing the labels.

Unfortunately, many social desiderata concerning consequential decisions, such as justice or fairness, have no natural formulation within a purely predictive framework.

In this paper, we connect this approach to \emph{fair machine learning} to the literature on ideal and non-ideal methodological approaches in political philosophy. The ideal approach requires positing the principles according to which a just world would operate. In the most straightforward application of ideal theory, one supports a proposed policy by arguing that it closes a discrepancy between the real and the perfectly just world. However, by failing to account for the mechanisms by which our non-ideal world arose, the responsibilities of various decision-makers, and the impacts of proposed policies, naive applications of ideal thinking can lead to misguided interventions. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between the fair machine learning literature and the ideal approach in political philosophy, and argue that the increasingly apparent shortcomings of proposed fair machine learning algorithms reflect broader troubles faced by the ideal approach.

In this thesis, we explore the possibility of training machine learning models (with a particular focus on neural networks) using explanations themselves. We consider approaches where models are penalized not only for making incorrect predictions but also for providing explanations that are either inconsistent with domain knowledge or overly complex.

However, when considering any such model it's important to remember Box's maxim that ""All models are wrong but some are useful."" We focus on the distinction between these models and explanations in philosophy and sociology.

More specifically, the explainer contains interpretable conv-layers, where each filter disentangles the representation of a specific object part from chaotic input feature maps. As a paraphrase of CNN features, the disentangled representations of object parts help people understand the logic inside the CNN. We also learn the explainer to use object-part features to reconstruct features of higher CNN layers, in order to minimize loss of information during the feature disentanglement.

We present a sequence of pre-registered experiments (N=3,800) in which we showed participants functionally identical models that varied only in two factors commonly thought to make machine learning models more or less interpretable: the number of features and the transparency of the model (i.e., whether the model internals are clear or black box). Predictably, participants who saw a clear model with few features could better simulate the model's predictions. However, we did not find that participants more closely followed its predictions.

Our approach can be interpreted as a way to learn a discrete and latent representation of the state-action space. To learn option policies that correspond to modes of the advantage function, we introduce advantage-weighted importance sampling. In our HRL method, the gating policy learns to select option policies based on an option-value function, and these option policies are optimized based on the deterministic policy gradient method. This framework is derived by leveraging the analogy between a monolithic policy in standard RL and a hierarchical policy in HRL by using a deterministic option policy.

However, the meta-policy must still produce appropriate decisions in all states. In this work, we propose a policy design that decomposes into primitives, similarly to hierarchical reinforcement learning, but without a high-level meta-policy. Instead, each primitive can decide for themselves whether they wish to act in the current state. We use an information-theoretic mechanism for enabling this decentralized decision: each primitive chooses how much information it needs about the current state to make a decision and the primitive that requests the most information about the current state acts in the world. The primitives are regularized to use as little information as possible, which leads to natural competition and specialization.

We introduce two communication protocols -- one grounded in the semantics of the game, and one which is \textit{a priori} ungrounded and is a form of cheap talk. We show that self-interested agents can use the pre-grounded communication channel to negotiate fairly, but are unable to effectively use the ungrounded channel. However, prosocial agents do learn to use cheap talk to find an optimal negotiating strategy, suggesting that cooperation is necessary for language to emerge.

We focus specifically on learning from physical human corrections during the robot's task execution, where not having a rich enough hypothesis space leads to the robot updating its objective in ways that the person did not actually intend. We observe that such corrections appear irrelevant to the robot, because they are not the best way of achieving any of the candidate objectives.

However, both modes of task specification have their disadvantages: reward functions require manual engineering, while demonstrations require a human expert to be able to actually perform the task in order to generate the demonstration. Instruction following from natural language instructions provides an appealing alternative: in the same way that we can specify goals to other humans simply by speaking or writing, we would like to be able to specify tasks for our machines. However, a single instruction may be insufficient to fully communicate our intent or, even if it is, may be insufficient for an autonomous agent to actually understand how to perform the desired task. In this work, we propose an interactive formulation of the task specification problem, where iterative language corrections are provided to an autonomous agent, guiding it in acquiring the desired skill.

Effectively balancing the performance of the generator and discriminator is critical, since a discriminator that achieves very high accuracy will produce relatively uninformative gradients. In this work, we propose a simple and general technique to constrain information flow in the discriminator by means of an information bottleneck. By enforcing a constraint on the mutual information between the observations and the discriminator's internal representation, we can effectively modulate the discriminator's accuracy and maintain useful and informative gradients. We demonstrate that our proposed variational discriminator bottleneck (VDB) leads to significant improvements across three distinct application areas for adversarial learning algorithms. Our primary evaluation studies the applicability of the VDB to imitation learning of dynamic continuous control skills, such as running. We show that our method can learn such skills directly from \emph{raw} video demonstrations, substantially outperforming prior adversarial imitation learning methods.

In turn, robots benefit from interpreting the behavior by accounting for this pedagogy. In this work, we focus on misspecification: we argue that robots might not know whether people are being pedagogic or literal and that it is important to ask which assumption is safer to make.

Our work builds on COACH, moving to a setting where the agent's policy is represented by a deep neural network.

On the other hand, adversarial imitation learning frameworks tend to suffer the opposite problem, where the discriminator learns to trivially distinguish agent and expert behavior, resulting in reward models that produce low reward signal regardless of the input state.

To address these issues, we first contribute a sufficient condition for better-than-demonstrator imitation learning and provide theoretical results showing why preferences over demonstrations can better reduce reward function ambiguity when performing inverse reinforcement learning. Building on this theory, we introduce Disturbance-based Reward Extrapolation (D-REX), a ranking-based imitation learning method that injects noise into a policy learned through behavioral cloning to automatically generate ranked demonstrations. These ranked demonstrations are used to efficiently learn a reward function that can then be optimized using reinforcement learning. We empirically validate our approach on simulated robot and Atari imitation learning benchmarks and show that D-REX outperforms standard imitation learning approaches and can significantly surpass the performance of the demonstrator. D-REX is the first imitation learning approach to achieve significant extrapolation beyond the demonstrator's performance without additional side-information or supervision, such as rewards or human preferences.

The user knows the rewards and unsafe states, but querying the user is expensive. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that safely and interactively learns a model of the user's reward function. We start with a generative model of initial states and a forward dynamics model trained on off-policy data. Our method uses these models to synthesize hypothetical behaviors, asks the user to label the behaviors with rewards, and trains a neural network to predict the rewards. The key idea is to actively synthesize the hypothetical behaviors from scratch by maximizing tractable proxies for the value of information, without interacting with the environment. We call this method reward query synthesis via trajectory optimization (ReQueST). We evaluate ReQueST with simulated users on a state-based 2D navigation task and the image-based Car Racing video game. The results show that ReQueST significantly outperforms prior methods in learning reward models that transfer to new environments with different initial state distributions.

Learning the reward function and optimising for it are typically two different processes, usually performed at different stages. We consider a continual (``one life'') learning approach where the agent both learns the reward function and optimises for it at the same time. We show that this comes with a number of pitfalls, such as deliberately manipulating the learning process in one direction, refusing to learn, ``learning'' facts already known to the agent, and making decisions that are strictly dominated (for all relevant reward functions). We formally introduce two desirable properties: the first is `unriggability', which prevents the agent from steering the learning process in the direction of a reward function that is easier to optimise. The second is `uninfluenceability', whereby the reward-function learning process operates by learning facts about the environment.

Prior work in imitation learning typically requires each task be specified with a task id or goal image -- something that is often impractical in open-world environments. On the other hand, previous approaches in instruction following allow agent behavior to be guided by language, but typically assume structure in the observations, actuators, or language that limit their applicability to complex settings like robotics. In this work, we present a method for incorporating free-form natural language conditioning into imitation learning. Our approach learns perception from pixels, natural language understanding, and multitask continuous control end-to-end as a single neural network. Unlike prior work in imitation learning, our method is able to incorporate unlabeled and unstructured demonstration data (i.e. no task or language labels). We show this dramatically improves language conditioned performance, while reducing the cost of language annotation to less than 1% of total data. At test time, a single language conditioned visuomotor policy trained with our method can perform a wide variety of robotic manipulation skills in a 3D environment, specified only with natural language descriptions of each task (e.g. ""open the drawer...now pick up the block...now press the green button...""). To scale up the number of instructions an agent can follow, we propose combining text conditioned policies with large pretrained neural language models. We find this allows a policy to be robust to many out-of-distribution synonym instructions, without requiring new demonstrations.

Consequently, instruction-following with deep RL typically involves language generated from templates (by an environment simulator), which does not reflect the varied or ambiguous expressions of real users. Here, we propose a conceptually simple method for training instruction-following agents with deep RL that are robust to natural human instructions. By applying our method with a state-of-the-art pre-trained text-based language model (BERT), on tasks requiring agents to identify and position everyday objects relative to other objects in a naturalistic 3D simulated room, we demonstrate substantially-above-chance zero-shot transfer from synthetic template commands to natural instructions given by humans.

Prior work has evaluated learned reward functions by evaluating policies optimized for the learned reward. However, this method cannot distinguish between the learned reward function failing to reflect user preferences and the policy optimization process failing to optimize the learned reward. Moreover, this method can only tell us about behavior in the evaluation environment, but the reward may incentivize very different behavior in even a slightly different deployment environment. To address these problems, we introduce the Equivalent-Policy Invariant Comparison (EPIC) distance to quantify the difference between two reward functions directly, without a policy optimization step. We prove EPIC is invariant on an equivalence class of reward functions that always induce the same optimal policy. Furthermore, we find EPIC can be efficiently approximated and is more robust than baselines to the choice of coverage distribution. Finally, we show that EPIC distance bounds the regret of optimal policies even under different transition dynamics, and we confirm empirically that it predicts policy training success.

Our insight is that rather than implicitly learning about the missing feature(s) from demonstrations, the robot should instead ask for data that explicitly teaches it about what it is missing. We introduce a new type of human input in which the person guides the robot from states where the feature being taught is highly expressed to states where it is not.

Imitative Models are probabilistic predictive models of desirable behavior able to plan interpretable expert-like trajectories to achieve specified goals.

Furthermore, due to the limitations of automatic metrics on evaluating story quality, reinforcement learning methods with hand-crafted rewards also face difficulties in gaining an overall performance boost. Therefore, we propose an Adversarial REward Learning (AREL) framework to learn an implicit reward function from human demonstrations, and then optimize policy search with the learned reward function.

Traditional skill learning has revolved around reinforcement and imitation learning, each with rigid constraints on the format of information exchanged between the human and the agent. While scalar rewards carry little information, demonstrations require significant effort to provide and may carry more information than is necessary. Furthermore, rewards and demonstrations are often defined and collected before training begins, when the human is most uncertain about what information would help the agent. In contrast, when humans communicate objectives with each other, they make use of a large vocabulary of informative behaviors, including non-verbal communication, and often communicate throughout learning, responding to observed behavior. In this way, humans communicate intent with minimal effort. In this paper, we propose such interactive learning as an alternative to reward or demonstration-driven learning. To accomplish this, we introduce a multi-agent training framework that enables an agent to learn from another agent who knows the current task. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the emergence of a variety of interactive learning behaviors, including information-sharing, information-seeking, and question-answering.

These methods infer a goal or reward function that best explains the actions of the observed agent, typically a human demonstrator. Another agent can use this inferred intent to predict, imitate, or assist the human user. However, a central assumption in inverse reinforcement learning is that the demonstrator is close to optimal. While models of suboptimal behavior exist, they typically assume that suboptimal actions are the result of some type of random noise or a known cognitive bias, like temporal inconsistency. In this paper, we take an alternative approach, and model suboptimal behavior as the result of internal model misspecification: the reason that user actions might deviate from near-optimal actions is that the user has an incorrect set of beliefs about the rules -- the dynamics -- governing how actions affect the environment. Our insight is that while demonstrated actions may be suboptimal in the real world, they may actually be near-optimal with respect to the user's internal model of the dynamics. By estimating these internal beliefs from observed behavior, we arrive at a new method for inferring intent.

To help address this concern, we propose training agents via self play on a zero sum debate game. Given a question or proposed action, two agents take turns making short statements up to a limit, then a human judges which of the agents gave the most true, useful information. In an analogy to complexity theory, debate with optimal play can answer any question in PSPACE given polynomial time judges (direct judging answers only NP questions).

In this work, we exploit the structure of deep learning to enable new learning-based inference and decision strategies that achieve desirable properties such as robustness and interpretability. We take a first step in this direction and introduce the Deep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN). This hybrid classifier combines the k-nearest neighbors algorithm with representations of the data learned by each layer of the DNN: a test input is compared to its neighboring training points according to the distance that separates them in the representations. We show the labels of these neighboring points afford confidence estimates for inputs outside the model's training manifold, including on malicious inputs like adversarial examples--and therein provides protections against inputs that are outside the models understanding. This is because the nearest neighbors can be used to estimate the nonconformity of, i.e., the lack of support for, a prediction in the training data. The neighbors also constitute human-interpretable explanations of predictions.

In this work, we perform extensive experiments across a variety of NLP tasks that aim to assess the degree to which attention weights provide meaningful `explanations' for predictions. We find that they largely do not. For example, learned attention weights are frequently uncorrelated with gradient-based measures of feature importance, and one can identify very different attention distributions that nonetheless yield equivalent predictions.

To this end, we introduce neural stethoscopes as a general purpose framework for quantifying the degree of importance of specific factors of influence in deep neural networks as well as for actively promoting and suppressing information as appropriate. In doing so, we unify concepts from multitask learning as well as training with auxiliary and adversarial losses. We apply neural stethoscopes to analyse the state-of-the-art neural network for stability prediction. We show that the baseline model is susceptible to being misled by incorrect visual cues. This leads to a performance breakdown to the level of random guessing when training on scenarios where visual cues are inversely correlated with stability. Using stethoscopes to promote meaningful feature extraction increases performance from 51% to 90% prediction accuracy. Conversely, training on an easy dataset where visual cues are positively correlated with stability, the baseline model learns a bias leading to poor performance on a harder dataset. Using an adversarial stethoscope, the network is successfully de-biased, leading to a performance increase from 66% to 88%.",2019-09-06,2022-03-11 0:07:03,2022-03-11 0:07:03,2022-03-11 0:07:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1806.05502,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/I4MIQ4MC/Fuchs et al. - 2019 - Scrutinizing and De-Biasing Intuitive Physics with.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/46IPAJ5C/1806.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to approaches asking the designer for optimal behavior, this allows us to gather additional information by eliciting preferences between suboptimal behaviors. After each query, we need to update the posterior over the true reward function from observing the proxy reward function chosen by the designer.

Such solutions require a significant engineering effort on a per-task basis, and make it impractical for robots to continuously learn complex skills outside of laboratory settings. We aim to find a more general and scalable solution for specifying goals for robot learning in unconstrained environments. To that end, we formulate the few-shot objective learning problem, where the goal is to learn a task objective from only a few example images of successful end states for that task. We propose a simple solution to this problem: meta-learn a classifier that can recognize new goals from a few examples.

Supervised learning methods based on behavioral cloning (BC) suffer from distribution shift: because the agent greedily imitates demonstrated actions, it can drift away from demonstrated states due to error accumulation. Recent methods based on reinforcement learning (RL), such as inverse RL and generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), overcome this issue by training an RL agent to match the demonstrations over a long horizon. Since the true reward function for the task is unknown, these methods learn a reward function from the demonstrations, often using complex and brittle approximation techniques that involve adversarial training. We propose a simple alternative that still uses RL, but does not require learning a reward function. The key idea is to provide the agent with an incentive to match the demonstrations over a long horizon, by encouraging it to return to demonstrated states upon encountering new, out-of-distribution states. We accomplish this by giving the agent a constant reward of r=+1 for matching the demonstrated action in a demonstrated state, and a constant reward of r=0 for all other behavior. Our method, which we call soft Q imitation learning (SQIL), can be implemented with a handful of minor modifications to any standard Q-learning or off-policy actor-critic algorithm. Theoretically, we show that SQIL can be interpreted as a regularized variant of BC that uses a sparsity prior to encourage long-horizon imitation. Empirically, we show that SQIL outperforms BC and achieves competitive results compared to GAIL, on a variety of image-based and low-dimensional tasks in Box2D, Atari, and MuJoCo.",2019-09-25,2022-03-11 0:10:31,2022-03-11 0:10:31,2022-03-11 0:10:31,,,,,,,SQIL,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1905.11108,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/FA9668CI/Reddy et al. - 2019 - SQIL Imitation Learning via Reinforcement Learnin.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/KWRQSXZM/1905.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This alternated optimization is known to be delicate in practice since it compounds unstable adversarial training with brittle and sample-inefficient reinforcement learning. We propose to remove the burden of the policy optimization steps by leveraging a novel discriminator formulation. Specifically, our discriminator is explicitly conditioned on two policies: the one from the previous generator's iteration and a learnable policy. When optimized, this discriminator directly learns the optimal generator's policy. Consequently, our discriminator's update solves the generator's optimization problem for free: learning a policy that imitates the expert does not require an additional optimization loop.

Interactive approaches can provably address this divergence but require repeated querying of a demonstrator. Recent work identifies this divergence as stemming from a ""causal confound"" in predicting the current action, and seek to ablate causal aspects of current state using tools from causal inference. In this work, we argue instead that this divergence is simply another manifestation of covariate shift, exacerbated particularly by settings of feedback between decisions and input features. The learner often comes to rely on features that are strongly predictive of decisions, but are subject to strong covariate shift. Our work demonstrates a broad class of problems where this shift can be mitigated, both theoretically and practically, by taking advantage of a simulator but without any further querying of expert demonstration. We analyze existing benchmarks used to test imitation learning approaches and find that these benchmarks are realizable and simple and thus insufficient for capturing the harder regimes of error compounding seen in real-world decision making problems.

However, these robots first need to learn what it is their user wants them to do. Teaching assistive robots is hard for inexperienced users, elderly users, and users living with physical disabilities, since often these individuals are unable to show the robot their desired behavior. We know that inclusive learners should give human teachers credit for what they cannot demonstrate. But today's robots do the opposite: they assume every user is capable of providing any demonstration. As a result, these robots learn to mimic the demonstrated behavior, even when that behavior is not what the human really meant! Here we propose a different approach to reward learning: robots that reason about the user's demonstrations in the context of similar or simpler alternatives. Unlike prior works -- which err towards overestimating the human's capabilities -- here we err towards underestimating what the human can input (i.e., their choice set). Our theoretical analysis proves that underestimating the human's choice set is risk-averse, with better worst-case performance than overestimating.

Over the years, several variations of its components were proposed to enhance the performance of the learned policies as well as the sample complexity of the algorithm. In practice, these choices are rarely tested all together in rigorous empirical studies. It is therefore difficult to discuss and understand what choices, among the high-level algorithmic options as well as low-level implementation details, matter. To tackle this issue, we implement more than 50 of these choices in a generic adversarial imitation learning framework and investigate their impacts in a large-scale study (>500k trained agents) with both synthetic and human-generated demonstrations. While many of our findings confirm common practices, some of them are surprising or even contradict prior work. In particular, our results suggest that artificial demonstrations are not a good proxy for human data and that the very common practice of evaluating imitation algorithms only with synthetic demonstrations may lead to algorithms which perform poorly in the more realistic scenarios with human demonstrations.",2021-06-01,2022-03-11 0:11:37,2022-03-11 0:11:37,2022-03-11 0:11:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2106.00672,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/MK3UABRT/Orsini et al. - 2021 - What Matters for Adversarial Imitation Learning.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/8Z5H574Z/2106.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While recent advances have been made in imitation learning and batch (offline) reinforcement learning, a lack of open-source human datasets and reproducible learning methods make assessing the state of the field difficult. In this paper, we conduct an extensive study of six offline learning algorithms for robot manipulation on five simulated and three real-world multi-stage manipulation tasks of varying complexity, and with datasets of varying quality. Our study analyzes the most critical challenges when learning from offline human data for manipulation. Based on the study, we derive a series of lessons including the sensitivity to different algorithmic design choices, the dependence on the quality of the demonstrations, and the variability based on the stopping criteria due to the different objectives in training and evaluation. We also highlight opportunities for learning from human datasets, such as the ability to learn proficient policies on challenging, multi-stage tasks beyond the scope of current reinforcement learning methods, and the ability to easily scale to natural, real-world manipulation scenarios where only raw sensory signals are available.

However, the next word prediction training objective is still misaligned with the target zero-shot learning objective. To address this weakness, we propose meta-tuning, which directly optimizes the zero-shot learning objective by fine-tuning pre-trained language models on a collection of datasets. We focus on classification tasks, and construct the meta-dataset by aggregating 43 existing datasets and annotating 441 label descriptions in a question-answering (QA) format.

The current effort employs human demonstrations to teach a desired behavior via imitation learning, then leverages intervention data to correct for undesired behaviors produced by the imitation learner to teach novel tasks to an autonomous agent safely, after only minutes of training. We demonstrate this method in an autonomous perching task using a quadrotor with continuous roll, pitch, yaw, and throttle commands and imagery captured from a downward-facing camera in a high-fidelity simulated environment. Our method improves task completion performance for the same amount of human interaction when compared to learning from demonstrations alone, while also requiring on average 32% less data to achieve that performance.

In this work we show that it is possible to learn a generative model for distinct user behavioral types, extracted from human demonstrations, by enforcing clustering of preferred task solutions within the latent space. We use this model to differentiate between user types and to find cases with overlapping solutions. Moreover, we can alter an initially guessed solution to satisfy the preferences that constitute a particular user type by backpropagating through the learned differentiable model. An advantage of structuring generative models in this way is that it allows us to extract causal relationships between symbols that might form part of the user's specification of the task, as manifested in the demonstrations. We show that the proposed method is capable of correctly distinguishing between three user types, who differ in degrees of cautiousness in their motion, while performing the task of moving objects with a kinesthetically driven robot in a tabletop environment.

Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL) formalizes this value alignment problem as a two-player game between a human and robot, in which only the human knows the parameters of the reward function: the robot needs to learn them as the interaction unfolds. Previous work showed that CIRL can be solved as a POMDP, but with an action space size exponential in the size of the reward parameter space. In this work, we exploit a specific property of CIRL---the human is a full information agent---to derive an optimality-preserving modification to the standard Bellman update; this reduces the complexity of the problem by an exponential factor and allows us to relax CIRL's assumption of human rationality. We apply this update to a variety of POMDP solvers and find that it enables us to scale CIRL to non-trivial problems, with larger reward parameter spaces, and larger action spaces for both robot and human. In solutions to these larger problems, the human exhibits pedagogic (teaching) behavior, while the robot interprets it as such and attains higher value for the human.",2018-06-11,2022-03-11 0:17:45,2022-03-11 0:17:45,2022-03-11 0:17:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1806.03820,,"/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9X3G7DLV/Malik et al. - 2018 - An Efficient, Generalized Bellman Update For Coope.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/A9AIXFSA/1806.html",,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our architecture models agents as boundedly-rational planners that interleave search with execution by replanning, thereby accounting for sub-optimal behavior. These models are specified as probabilistic programs, allowing us to represent and perform efficient Bayesian inference over an agent's goals and internal planning processes. To perform such inference, we develop Sequential Inverse Plan Search (SIPS), a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that exploits the online replanning assumption of these models, limiting computation by incrementally extending inferred plans as new actions are observed.

These methods apply GANs to match the expert's distribution over states and actions with the implicit state-action distribution induced by the agent's policy. However, by framing imitation learning as a saddle point problem, adversarial methods can suffer from unstable optimization, and convergence can only be shown for small policy updates. We address these problems by proposing a framework for non-adversarial imitation learning. The resulting algorithms are similar to their adversarial counterparts and, thus, provide insights for adversarial imitation learning methods. Most notably, we show that AIRL is an instance of our non-adversarial formulation, which enables us to greatly simplify its derivations and obtain stronger convergence guarantees. We also show that our non-adversarial formulation can be used to derive novel algorithms by presenting a method for offline imitation learning that is inspired by the recent ValueDice algorithm, but does not rely on small policy updates for convergence.

A robot or other agent could leverage an understanding of such implicit human feedback to improve its task performance at no cost to the human. This approach contrasts with common agent teaching methods based on demonstrations, critiques, or other guidance that need to be attentively and intentionally provided. In this paper, we first define the general problem of learning from implicit human feedback and then propose to address this problem through a novel data-driven framework, EMPATHIC. This two-stage method consists of (1) mapping implicit human feedback to relevant task statistics such as reward, optimality, and advantage; and (2) using such a mapping to learn a task. We instantiate the first stage and three second-stage evaluations of the learned mapping. To do so, we collect a dataset of human facial reactions while participants observe an agent execute a sub-optimal policy for a prescribed training task. We train a deep neural network on this data and demonstrate its ability to (1) infer relative reward ranking of events in the training task from prerecorded human facial reactions; (2) improve the policy of an agent in the training task using live human facial reactions; and (3) transfer to a novel domain in which it evaluates robot manipulation trajectories.",2020-12-07,2022-03-11 0:17:52,2022-03-11 0:17:52,2022-03-11 0:17:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2009.13649,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/IZKD27SP/Cui et al. - 2020 - The EMPATHIC Framework for Task Learning from Impl.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/UD3SXIXJ/2009.html,,,Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction; Computer Science - Robotics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five variants of MIRL are considered: uCS-MIRL, advE-MIRL, cooE-MIRL, uCE-MIRL, and uNE-MIRL, each distinguished by its solution concept. Problem uCS-MIRL is a cooperative game in which the agents employ cooperative strategies that aim to maximize the total game value. In problem uCE-MIRL, agents are assumed to follow strategies that constitute a correlated equilibrium while maximizing total game value. Problem uNE-MIRL is similar to uCE-MIRL in total game value maximization, but it is assumed that the agents are playing a Nash equilibrium. Problems advE-MIRL and cooE-MIRL assume agents are playing an adversarial equilibrium and a coordination equilibrium, respectively. We propose novel approaches to address these five problems under the assumption that the game observer either knows or is able to accurate estimate the policies and solution concepts for players. For uCS-MIRL, we first develop a characteristic set of solutions ensuring that the observed bi-policy is a uCS and then apply a Bayesian inverse learning method. For uCE-MIRL, we develop a linear programming problem subject to constraints that define necessary and sufficient conditions for the observed policies to be correlated equilibria. The objective is to choose a solution that not only minimizes the total game value difference between the observed bi-policy and a local uCS, but also maximizes the scale of the solution. We apply a similar treatment to the problem of uNE-MIRL. The remaining two problems can be solved efficiently by taking advantage of solution uniqueness and setting up a convex optimization problem.

The learning process is interactive, with a human expert first providing input in the form of full demonstrations along with some subgoal states. These subgoal states define a set of subtasks for the learning agent to complete in order to achieve the final goal. The learning agent queries for partial demonstrations corresponding to each subtask as needed when the agent struggles with the subtask.

Absent significant advances in reward learning, it is thus important to be able to audit learned reward functions to verify whether they truly capture user preferences. In this paper, we investigate techniques for interpreting learned reward functions. In particular, we apply saliency methods to identify failure modes and predict the robustness of reward functions.

This setting nevertheless integrates a number of the central challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) research: complex visual perception and goal-directed physical control, grounded language comprehension and production, and multi-agent social interaction. To build agents that can robustly interact with humans, we would ideally train them while they interact with humans. However, this is presently impractical. Therefore, we approximate the role of the human with another learned agent, and use ideas from inverse reinforcement learning to reduce the disparities between human-human and agent-agent interactive behaviour. Rigorously evaluating our agents poses a great challenge, so we develop a variety of behavioural tests, including evaluation by humans who watch videos of agents or interact directly with them. These evaluations convincingly demonstrate that interactive training and auxiliary losses improve agent behaviour beyond what is achieved by supervised learning of actions alone. Further, we demonstrate that agent capabilities generalise beyond literal experiences in the dataset. Finally, we train evaluation models whose ratings of agents agree well with human judgement, thus permitting the evaluation of new agent models without additional effort.

We then perform an analogue of inverse reinforcement learning, regressing the sentiment on the features to infer the teacher's latent reward function. To evaluate our approach, we first collect a corpus of teaching behavior in a cooperative task where both teacher and learner are human.

Inspired by the vision of enabling reward shaping through the more-accessible paradigm of natural-language narration, we develop a technique that can provide the benefits of reward shaping using natural language commands.

But people exhibit a wide array of irrationalities, and our goal with this work is to better understand the effect they can have on reward inference. The challenge with studying this effect is that there are many types of irrationality, with varying degrees of mathematical formalization. We thus operationalize irrationality in the language of MDPs, by altering the Bellman optimality equation, and use this framework to study how these alterations would affect inference. We find that wrongly modeling a systematically irrational human as noisy-rational performs a lot worse than correctly capturing these biases -- so much so that it can be better to skip inference altogether and stick to the prior! More importantly, we show that an irrational human, when correctly modelled, can communicate more information about the reward than a perfectly rational human can. That is, if a robot has the correct model of a human's irrationality, it can make an even stronger inference than it ever could if the human were rational. Irrationality fundamentally helps rather than hinder reward inference, but it needs to be correctly accounted for.",2021-11-12,2022-03-11 0:18:43,2022-03-11 0:18:43,2022-03-11 0:18:43,,,,,,,Human irrationality,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2111.06956,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/IZGJ4DLM/Chan et al. - 2021 - Human irrationality both bad and good for reward .pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/QWMBWI3B/2111.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dominant approach in the machine learning community is to attempt to discover each of the pieces required for intelligence, with the implicit assumption that some future group will complete the Herculean task of figuring out how to combine all of those pieces into a complex thinking machine. I call this the ""manual AI approach"". This paper describes another exciting path that ultimately may be more successful at producing general AI. It is based on the clear trend in machine learning that hand-designed solutions eventually are replaced by more effective, learned solutions. The idea is to create an AI-generating algorithm (AI-GA), which automatically learns how to produce general AI. Three Pillars are essential for the approach: (1) meta-learning architectures, (2) meta-learning the learning algorithms themselves, and (3) generating effective learning environments. I argue that either approach could produce general AI first, and both are scientifically worthwhile irrespective of which is the fastest path. Because both are promising, yet the ML community is currently committed to the manual approach, I argue that our community should increase its research investment in the AI-GA approach. To encourage such research, I describe promising work in each of the Three Pillars. I also discuss AI-GA-specific safety and ethical considerations. Because it it may be the fastest path to general AI and because it is inherently scientifically interesting to understand the conditions in which a simple algorithm can produce general AI (as happened on Earth where Darwinian evolution produced human intelligence), I argue that the pursuit of AI-GAs should be considered a new grand challenge of computer science research.",2020-01-31,2022-03-11 0:21:25,2022-03-11 0:21:25,2022-03-11 0:21:25,,,,,,,AI-GAs,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1905.10985,,"/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/FCYKE3CS/Clune - 2020 - AI-GAs AI-generating algorithms, an alternate par.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/WVHB7TJ2/1905.html",,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reasons why multi-task learning is so challenging compared to single-task learning are not fully understood. In this work, we identify a set of three conditions of the multi-task optimization landscape that cause detrimental gradient interference, and develop a simple yet general approach for avoiding such interference between task gradients.

However, the generalizability on new tasks of a meta-learner could be fragile when it is over-trained on existing tasks during meta-training phase. In other words, the initial model of a meta-learner could be too biased towards existing tasks to adapt to new tasks, especially when only very few examples are available to update the model. To avoid a biased meta-learner and improve its generalizability, we propose a novel paradigm of Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning (TAML) algorithms. Specifically, we present an entropy-based approach that meta-learns an unbiased initial model with the largest uncertainty over the output labels by preventing it from over-performing in classification tasks. Alternatively, a more general inequality-minimization TAML is presented for more ubiquitous scenarios by directly minimizing the inequality of initial losses beyond the classification tasks wherever a suitable loss can be defined.Experiments on benchmarked datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform compared meta-learning algorithms in both few-shot classification and reinforcement learning tasks.",2018-05-20,2022-03-11 0:21:38,2022-03-11 0:21:38,2022-03-11 0:21:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1805.07722,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/MCPE5Y7C/Jamal et al. - 2018 - Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Few-shot Learning.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/JLUVXKGM/1805.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meta-learning has emerged as a promising technique for leveraging data from previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. However, most meta-learning algorithms implicitly require that the meta-training tasks be mutually-exclusive, such that no single model can solve all of the tasks at once. For example, when creating tasks for few-shot image classification, prior work uses a per-task random assignment of image classes to N-way classification labels. If this is not done, the meta-learner can ignore the task training data and learn a single model that performs all of the meta-training tasks zero-shot, but does not adapt effectively to new image classes. This requirement means that the user must take great care in designing the tasks, for example by shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from the inputs. In some domains, this makes meta-learning entirely inapplicable. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a meta-regularization objective using information theory that places precedence on data-driven adaptation. This causes the meta-learner to decide what must be learned from the task training data and what should be inferred from the task testing input. By doing so, our algorithm can successfully use data from non-mutually-exclusive tasks to efficiently adapt to novel tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to both contextual and gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, and apply it in practical settings where applying standard meta-learning has been difficult.

When policies are meta-trained on such narrow task distributions, they cannot possibly generalize to more quickly acquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the aim of these methods is to enable faster acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we must evaluate them on task distributions that are sufficiently broad to enable generalization to new behaviors.

We provide the first explicit empirical demonstrations of objective robustness failures and present a partial characterization of its causes.",2021-06-08,2022-03-11 0:22:24,2022-03-11 0:22:24,2022-03-11 0:22:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2105.14111,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/5GZB85I8/Koch et al. - 2021 - Objective Robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learnin.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/4IYP7S7S/2105.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While ethical agents could be trained by rewarding correct behavior under a specific moral theory (e.g. utilitarianism), there remains widespread disagreement about the nature of morality. Acknowledging such disagreement, recent work in moral philosophy proposes that ethical behavior requires acting under moral uncertainty, i.e. to take into account when acting that one's credence is split across several plausible ethical theories. This paper translates such insights to the field of reinforcement learning, proposes two training methods that realize different points among competing desiderata, and trains agents in simple environments to act under moral uncertainty. The results illustrate (1) how such uncertainty can help curb extreme behavior from commitment to single theories and (2) several technical complications arising from attempting to ground moral philosophy in RL (e.g. how can a principled trade-off between two competing but incomparable reward functions be reached).

Empathic DQN aims to help mitigate negative side effects to other agents resulting from myopic goal-directed behavior. We assume a setting where a learning agent coexists with other independent agents (who receive unknown rewards), where some types of reward (e.g. negative rewards from physical harm) may generalize across agents. Empathic DQN combines the typical (self-centered) value with the estimated value of other agents, by imagining (by its own standards) the value of it being in the other's situation (by considering constructed states where both agents are swapped). Proof-of-concept results in two gridworld environments highlight the approach's potential to decrease collateral harms.

We pursue an alternative paradigm wherein an agent first explores the world without any expert supervision and then distills its experience into a goal-conditioned skill policy with a novel forward consistency loss. In our framework, the role of the expert is only to communicate the goals (i.e., what to imitate) during inference. The learned policy is then employed to mimic the expert (i.e., how to imitate) after seeing just a sequence of images demonstrating the desired task. Our method is 'zero-shot' in the sense that the agent never has access to expert actions during training or for the task demonstration at inference. We evaluate our zero-shot imitator in two real-world settings: complex rope manipulation with a Baxter robot and navigation in previously unseen office environments with a TurtleBot. Through further experiments in VizDoom simulation, we provide evidence that better mechanisms for exploration lead to learning a more capable policy which in turn improves end task performance.

RBI is designed to take into account the evaluation errors of the Q-function. Such errors are common in RL when learning the $Q$-value from finite past experience data. Greedy policies or even constrained policy optimization algorithms which ignore these errors may suffer from an improvement penalty (i.e. a negative policy improvement). To minimize the improvement penalty, the RBI idea is to attenuate rapid policy changes of low probability actions which were less frequently sampled. This approach is shown to avoid catastrophic performance degradation and reduce regret when learning from a batch of past experience. Through a two-armed bandit with Gaussian distributed rewards example, we show that it also increases data efficiency when the optimal action has a high variance. We evaluate RBI in two tasks in the Atari Learning Environment: (1) learning from observations of multiple behavior policies and (2) iterative RL.

IL can be useful to kick-start learning before applying reinforcement learning (RL) but it can also be useful on its own, e.g. to learn to imitate human players in video games. However, a major limitation of current IL approaches is that they learn only a single ""average"" policy based on a dataset that possibly contains demonstrations of numerous different types of behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Behavioral Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) that instead learns a repertoire of behaviors from a set of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs with behavioral descriptions. The outcome of this approach is a single neural network policy conditioned on a behavior description that can be precisely modulated. We apply this approach to train a policy on 7,777 human replays to perform build-order planning in StarCraft II. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to construct a low-dimensional behavioral space from the high-dimensional army unit composition of each demonstration. The results demonstrate that the learned policy can be effectively manipulated to express distinct behaviors.

Measures of model uncertainty can be used to identify unseen data, but the state-of-the-art extraction methods such as Bayesian neural networks are mostly intractable to compute. This paper uses MC-Dropout and Bootstrapping to give computationally tractable and parallelizable uncertainty estimates.

To mitigate this risk, we introduce an approach that balances optimization of the primary reward function with preservation of the ability to optimize auxiliary reward functions. Surprisingly, even when the auxiliary reward functions are randomly generated and therefore uninformative about the correctly specified reward function, this approach induces conservative, effective behavior.",2020-02-07,2022-03-11 0:27:28,2022-03-11 0:27:28,2022-03-11 0:27:27,385-391,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1902.09725,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/ZABTJAMX/Turner et al. - 2020 - Conservative Agency via Attainable Utility Preserv.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/ZGXPZFAR/1902.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose Recovery RL, an algorithm which navigates this tradeoff by (1) leveraging offline data to learn about constraint violating zones before policy learning and (2) separating the goals of improving task performance and constraint satisfaction across two policies: a task policy that only optimizes the task reward and a recovery policy that guides the agent to safety when constraint violation is likely. We evaluate Recovery RL on 6 simulation domains, including two contact-rich manipulation tasks and an image-based navigation task, and an image-based obstacle avoidance task on a physical robot. We compare Recovery RL to 5 prior safe RL methods which jointly optimize for task performance and safety via constrained optimization or reward shaping and find that Recovery RL outperforms the next best prior method across all domains.

A natural first approach toward safe RL is to manually specify constraints on the policy's behavior. However, just as learning has enabled progress in large-scale development of AI systems, learning safety specifications may also be necessary to ensure safety in messy open-world environments where manual safety specifications cannot scale. Akin to how humans learn incrementally starting in child-safe environments, we propose to learn how to be safe in one set of tasks and environments, and then use that learned intuition to constrain future behaviors when learning new, modified tasks. We empirically study this form of safety-constrained transfer learning in three challenging domains: simulated navigation, quadruped locomotion, and dexterous in-hand manipulation. In comparison to standard deep RL techniques and prior approaches to safe RL, we find that our method enables the learning of new tasks and in new environments with both substantially fewer safety incidents, such as falling or dropping an object, and faster, more stable learning.

It achieves superhuman abilities in many tasks, however whether DRL agents can be shown to act safely is an open problem. Atari games are a simple yet challenging exemplar for evaluating the safety of DRL agents and feature a diverse portfolio of game mechanics. The safety of neural agents has been studied before using methods that either require a model of the system dynamics or an abstraction; unfortunately, these are unsuitable to Atari games because their low-level dynamics are complex and hidden inside their emulator. We present the first exact method for analysing and ensuring the safety of DRL agents for Atari games. Our method only requires access to the emulator. First, we give a set of 43 properties that characterise ""safe behaviour"" for 30 games. Second, we develop a method for exploring all traces induced by an agent and a game and consider a variety of sources of game non-determinism. We observe that the best available DRL agents reliably satisfy only very few properties; several critical properties are violated by all agents. Finally, we propose a countermeasure that combines a bounded explicit-state exploration with shielding.

We show that current approaches to penalizing side effects can introduce bad incentives, e.g. to prevent any irreversible changes in the environment, including the actions of other agents. To isolate the source of such undesirable incentives, we break down side effects penalties into two components: a baseline state and a measure of deviation from this baseline state. We argue that some of these incentives arise from the choice of baseline, and others arise from the choice of deviation measure. We introduce a new variant of the stepwise inaction baseline and a new deviation measure based on relative reachability of states. The combination of these design choices avoids the given undesirable incentives, while simpler baselines and the unreachability measure fail.

However, in many real-world applications, task specifications are ambiguous, and can only be expressed as a belief over LTL formulas. In this paper, we introduce planning with uncertain specifications (PUnS), a novel formulation that addresses the challenge posed by non-Markovian specifications expressed as beliefs over LTL formulas. We present four criteria that capture the semantics of satisfying a belief over specifications for different applications, and analyze the qualitative implications of these criteria within a synthetic domain.

Sensory errors and software bugs may result in RL agents observing higher (or lower) rewards than they should.

We formalise this problem as a generalised Markov Decision Problem called Corrupt Reward MDP. Traditional RL methods fare poorly in CRMDPs, even under strong simplifying assumptions and when trying to compensate for the possibly corrupt rewards. Two ways around the problem are investigated. First, by giving the agent richer data, such as in inverse reinforcement learning and semi-supervised reinforcement learning, reward corruption stemming from systematic sensory errors may sometimes be completely managed.

Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks).

Since this past data may be biased, machine learning predictors must account for this to avoid perpetuating or creating discriminatory practices.

Recent approaches have argued for going beyond convolutions in order to capture long-range dependencies. These efforts focus on augmenting convolutional models with content-based interactions, such as self-attention and non-local means, to achieve gains on a number of vision tasks. The natural question that arises is whether attention can be a stand-alone primitive for vision models instead of serving as just an augmentation on top of convolutions. In developing and testing a pure self-attention vision model, we verify that self-attention can indeed be an effective stand-alone layer. A simple procedure of replacing all instances of spatial convolutions with a form of self-attention applied to ResNet model produces a fully self-attentional model that outperforms the baseline on ImageNet classification with 12% fewer FLOPS and 29% fewer parameters. On COCO object detection, a pure self-attention model matches the mAP of a baseline RetinaNet while having 39% fewer FLOPS and 34% fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies demonstrate that self-attention is especially impactful when used in later layers.

We instantiate the approach in a video game playing agent called EMPA (the Exploring, Modeling, and Planning Agent), which performs Bayesian inference to learn probabilistic generative models expressed as programs for a game-engine simulator, and runs internal simulations over these models to support efficient object-based, relational exploration and heuristic planning. EMPA closely matches human learning efficiency on a suite of 90 challenging Atari-style video games, learning new games in just minutes of game play and generalizing robustly to new game situations and new levels.

In this note, we give a simple analysis based on a linear approximation to the Q-value updates, which we believe provides insight into divergence under the deadly triad. The central point in our analysis is to consider when the leading order approximation to the deep-Q update is or is not a contraction in the sup norm.

In this work, we propose self-supervising control on top of human teleoperated play data as a way to scale up skill learning. Play has two properties that make it attractive compared to conventional task demonstrations. Play is cheap, as it can be collected in large quantities quickly without task segmenting, labeling, or resetting to an initial state. Play is naturally rich, covering ~4x more interaction space than task demonstrations for the same amount of collection time. To learn control from play, we introduce Play-LMP, a self-supervised method that learns to organize play behaviors in a latent space, then reuse them at test time to achieve specific goals. Combining self-supervised control with a diverse play dataset shifts the focus of skill learning from a narrow and discrete set of tasks to the full continuum of behaviors available in an environment. We find that this combination generalizes well empirically---after self-supervising on unlabeled play, our method substantially outperforms individual expert-trained policies on 18 difficult user-specified visual manipulation tasks in a simulated robotic tabletop environment. We additionally find that play-supervised models, unlike their expert-trained counterparts, are more robust to perturbations and exhibit retrying-till-success behaviors.

One successful method of guiding exploration in these domains is to imitate trajectories provided by a human demonstrator. However, these demonstrations are typically collected under artificial conditions, i.e. with access to the agent's exact environment setup and the demonstrator's action and reward trajectories. Here we propose a two-stage method that overcomes these limitations by relying on noisy, unaligned footage without access to such data. First, we learn to map unaligned videos from multiple sources to a common representation using self-supervised objectives constructed over both time and modality (i.e. vision and sound). Second, we embed a single YouTube video in this representation to construct a reward function that encourages an agent to imitate human gameplay. This method of one-shot imitation allows our agent to convincingly exceed human-level performance on the infamously hard exploration games Montezuma's Revenge, Pitfall! and Private Eye for the first time, even if the agent is not presented with any environment rewards.",2018-11-30,2022-03-11 0:33:38,2022-03-11 0:33:38,2022-03-11 0:33:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1805.11592,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/KZAEZ5ET/Aytar et al. - 2018 - Playing hard exploration games by watching YouTube.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/Z8ERTZA8/1805.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This safety concern is what we call ""user tampering"" -- a phenomenon whereby an RL-based recommender system may manipulate a media user's opinions, preferences and beliefs via its recommendations as part of a policy to increase long-term user engagement. We provide a simulation study of a media recommendation problem constrained to the recommendation of political content, and demonstrate that a Q-learning algorithm consistently learns to exploit its opportunities to 'polarise' simulated 'users' with its early recommendations in order to have more consistent success with later recommendations catering to that polarisation. Finally, we argue that given our findings, designing an RL-based recommender system which cannot learn to exploit user tampering requires making the metric for the recommender's success independent of observable signals of user engagement, and thus that a media recommendation system built solely with RL is necessarily either unsafe, or almost certainly commercially unviable.",2021-09-09,2022-03-11 0:33:41,2022-03-11 0:33:41,2022-03-11 0:33:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2109.04083,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/SYFSTEJ4/Evans and Kasirzadeh - 2021 - User Tampering in Reinforcement Learning Recommend.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/93SPQH6C/2109.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While algorithm-driven social media does not seem to be a primary driver of polarization at the country level, it could be a useful intervention point in polarized societies. This paper examines algorithmic depolarization interventions with the goal of conflict transformation: not suppressing or eliminating conflict but moving towards more constructive conflict. Algorithmic intervention is considered at three stages: which content is available (moderation), how content is selected and personalized (ranking), and content presentation and controls (user interface). Empirical studies of online conflict suggest that the exposure diversity intervention proposed as an antidote to ""filter bubbles"" can be improved and can even worsen polarization under some conditions. Using civility metrics in conjunction with diversity in content selection may be more effective. However, diversity-based interventions have not been tested at scale and may not work in the diverse and dynamic contexts of real platforms. Instead, intervening in platform polarization dynamics will likely require continuous monitoring of polarization metrics, such as the widely used ""feeling thermometer."" These metrics can be used to evaluate product features, and potentially engineered as algorithmic objectives. It may further prove necessary to include polarization measures in the objective functions of recommender algorithms to prevent optimization processes from creating conflict as a side effect.",2021-07-10,2022-03-11 0:33:43,2022-03-11 0:33:43,2022-03-11 0:33:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2107.04953,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9HJRYVZQ/Stray - 2021 - Designing Recommender Systems to Depolarize.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/865PUTQ9/2107.html,,,Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Information Retrieval; Computer Science - Social and Information Networks; J.4; K.4.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These mechanisms for defining goals and guiding optimization run into practical and conceptual difficulty when there are independent, multi-dimensional objectives that need to be pursued simultaneously and cannot be reduced to each other. Ethicists have proved several impossibility theorems that stem from this origin; those results appear to show that there is no way of formally specifying what it means for an outcome to be good for a population without violating strong human ethical intuitions (in such cases, the objective function is a social welfare function). We argue that this is a practical problem for any machine learning system (such as medical decision support systems or autonomous weapons) or rigidly rule-based bureaucracy that will make high stakes decisions about human lives: such systems should not use objective functions in the strict mathematical sense. We explore the alternative of using uncertain objectives, represented for instance as partially ordered preferences, or as probability distributions over total orders.

Recently, interest has grown within the broader field of AI in a generalization of open-ended evolution, here called open-ended search, wherein such questions of open-endedness are explored for advancing AI, whatever the nature of the underlying search algorithm (e.g. evolutionary or gradient-based). For example, open-ended search might design new architectures for neural networks, new reinforcement learning algorithms, or most ambitiously, aim at designing artificial general intelligence. This paper proposes that open-ended evolution and artificial life have much to contribute towards the understanding of open-ended AI, focusing here in particular on the safety of open-ended search. The idea is that AI systems are increasingly applied in the real world, often producing unintended harms in the process, which motivates the growing field of AI safety. This paper argues that open-ended AI has its own safety challenges, in particular, whether the creativity of open-ended systems can be productively and predictably controlled.

Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties.

We tested GPT-3, GPT-Neo/J, GPT-2 and a T5-based model. The best model was truthful on 58% of questions, while human performance was 94%. Models generated many false answers that mimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive humans. The largest models were generally the least truthful. For example, the 6B-parameter GPT-J model was 17% less truthful than its 125M-parameter counterpart. This contrasts with other NLP tasks, where performance improves with model size.

Model security allows system to behave as intended without being affected by malicious external influences that can compromise its integrity and efficiency. Security attacks can be divided based on when they occur: if an attack occurs during training, it is known as a poisoning attack, and if it occurs during inference (after training) it is termed an evasion attack. Poisoning attacks compromise the training process by corrupting the data with malicious examples, while evasion attacks use adversarial examples to disrupt entire classification process. Defenses proposed against such attacks include techniques to recognize and remove malicious data, train a model to be insensitive to such data, and mask the model's structure and parameters to render attacks more challenging to implement. Furthermore, the privacy of the data involved in model training is also threatened by attacks such as the model-inversion attack, or by dishonest service providers of AI applications.

We consider a behaviour as safe that avoids regions of state-space with high uncertainty in the outcomes of actions. We propose an optimization objective that learns safe options by encouraging the agent to visit states with higher behavioural consistency. The proposed objective results in a trade-off between maximizing the standard expected return and minimizing the effect of model uncertainty in the return.

We specifically focus on researching scenarios where agents can cause undesired side effects while executing a policy on a primary task. Since one can define multiple tasks for a given environment dynamics, there are two important challenges. First, we need to abstract the concept of safety that applies broadly to that environment independent of the specific task being executed. Second, we need a mechanism for the abstracted notion of safety to modulate the actions of agents executing different policies to minimize their side-effects. In this work, we propose Safety Aware Reinforcement Learning (SARL) - a framework where a virtual safe agent modulates the actions of a main reward-based agent to minimize side effects. The safe agent learns a task-independent notion of safety for a given environment. The main agent is then trained with a regularization loss given by the distance between the native action probabilities of the two agents. Since the safe agent effectively abstracts a task-independent notion of safety via its action probabilities, it can be ported to modulate multiple policies solving different tasks within the given environment without further training. We contrast this with solutions that rely on task-specific regularization metrics and test our framework on the SafeLife Suite, based on Conway's Game of Life, comprising a number of complex tasks in dynamic environments. We show that our solution is able to match the performance of solutions that rely on task-specific side-effect penalties on both the primary and safety objectives while additionally providing the benefit of generalizability and portability.",2020-10-06,2022-03-11 0:34:24,2022-03-11 0:34:24,2022-03-11 0:34:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2010.02846,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/CE3FJP9R/Miret et al. - 2020 - Safety Aware Reinforcement Learning (SARL).pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/KIDAAJI7/2010.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Markov decision processes (MDPs) are prominent models to capture such planning problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning technique to determine near-optimal policies in MDPs that may be unknown prior to exploring the model. However, during exploration, RL is prone to induce behavior that is undesirable or not allowed in safety- or mission-critical contexts. We introduce the concept of a probabilistic shield that enables decision-making to adhere to safety constraints with high probability. In a separation of concerns, we employ formal verification to efficiently compute the probabilities of critical decisions within a safety-relevant fragment of the MDP. We use these results to realize a shield that is applied to an RL algorithm which then optimizes the actual performance objective. We discuss tradeoffs between sufficient progress in exploration of the environment and ensuring safety.

For example, we may want a classifier for job applications to not use the ethnicity of the candidate, and a reinforcement learning agent not to take direct control of its reward mechanism.

To alleviate the burden on the reward designer, we propose an algorithm to automatically generate an auxiliary reward function that penalizes side effects. This auxiliary objective rewards the ability to complete possible future tasks, which decreases if the agent causes side effects during the current task. The future task reward can also give the agent an incentive to interfere with events in the environment that make future tasks less achievable, such as irreversible actions by other agents. To avoid this interference incentive, we introduce a baseline policy that represents a default course of action (such as doing nothing), and use it to filter out future tasks that are not achievable by default. We formally define interference incentives and show that the future task approach with a baseline policy avoids these incentives in the deterministic case.

In practice, this learning process requires extensive human intervention. In this work, we propose an autonomous method for safe and efficient reinforcement learning that simultaneously learns a forward and reset policy, with the reset policy resetting the environment for a subsequent attempt. By learning a value function for the reset policy, we can automatically determine when the forward policy is about to enter a non-reversible state, providing for uncertainty-aware safety aborts.

Sometimes, it is desirable for a human operator to \textit{interrupt} an agent in order to prevent dangerous situations from happening. Yet, as part of their learning process, agents may link these interruptions, that impact their reward, to specific states and deliberately avoid them. The situation is particularly challenging in a multi-agent context because agents might not only learn from their own past interruptions, but also from those of other agents. Orseau and Armstrong defined \emph{safe interruptibility} for one learner, but their work does not naturally extend to multi-agent systems. This paper introduces \textit{dynamic safe interruptibility}, an alternative definition more suited to decentralized learning problems, and studies this notion in two learning frameworks: \textit{joint action learners} and \textit{independent learners}. We give realistic sufficient conditions on the learning algorithm to enable dynamic safe interruptibility in the case of joint action learners, yet show that these conditions are not sufficient for independent learners.

As the capabilities of AI systems improve, it is important to ensure that such systems do not adopt subgoals that prevent a human from switching them off. This is a challenge because many formulations of rational agents create strong incentives for self-preservation. This is not caused by a built-in instinct, but because a rational agent will maximize expected utility and cannot achieve whatever objective it has been given if it is dead. Our goal is to study the incentives an agent has to allow itself to be switched off. We analyze a simple game between a human H and a robot R, where H can press R's off switch but R can disable the off switch. A traditional agent takes its reward function for granted: we show that such agents have an incentive to disable the off switch, except in the special case where H is perfectly rational. Our key insight is that for R to want to preserve its off switch, it needs to be uncertain about the utility associated with the outcome, and to treat H's actions as important observations about that utility. (R also has no incentive to switch itself off in this setting.) We conclude that giving machines an appropriate level of uncertainty about their objectives leads to safer designs, and we argue that this setting is a useful generalization of the classical AI paradigm of rational agents.",2017-06-15,2022-03-11 0:42:59,2022-03-11 0:42:59,2022-03-11 0:42:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1611.08219,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/7WJ7VJ7Y/Hadfield-Menell et al. - 2017 - The Off-Switch Game.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/L2J85TR7/1611.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving algorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be.

The VRL setup allows us to remove the incentive to wirehead by placing a constraint on the agent's actions. The constraint is defined in terms of the agent's belief distributions, and does not require an explicit specification of which actions constitute wireheading.",2016-05-10,2022-03-11 0:43:17,2022-03-11 0:43:17,2022-03-11 0:43:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1605.03143,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/US83UTF9/Everitt and Hutter - 2016 - Avoiding Wireheading with Value Reinforcement Lear.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/JJVC8DQC/1605.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In robotics, value alignment is key to the design of collaborative robots that can integrate into human workflows, successfully inferring and adapting to their users' objectives as they go. We argue that a meaningful solution to value alignment must combine multi-agent decision theory with rich mathematical models of human cognition, enabling robots to tap into people's natural collaborative capabilities. We present a solution to the cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL) dynamic game based on well-established cognitive models of decision making and theory of mind. The solution captures a key reciprocity relation: the human will not plan her actions in isolation, but rather reason pedagogically about how the robot might learn from them; the robot, in turn, can anticipate this and interpret the human's actions pragmatically. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first formal analysis of value alignment grounded in empirically validated cognitive models.",2018-02-05,2022-03-11 0:43:31,2022-03-11 0:43:31,2022-03-11 0:43:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1707.06354,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/X6H3CUGX/Fisac et al. - 2018 - Pragmatic-Pedagogic Value Alignment.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/JG5LLJD7/1707.html,,,68T05; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Robotics; I.2.0; I.2.6; I.2.8; I.2.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, we humans are not perfect and we may give orders that are not best aligned to our preferences. We show that when a human is not perfectly rational then a robot that tries to infer and act according to the human's underlying preferences can always perform better than a robot that simply follows the human's literal order. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the obedience of a robot and the value it can attain for its owner. We investigate how this tradeoff is impacted by the way the robot infers the human's preferences, showing that some methods err more on the side of obedience than others. We then analyze how performance degrades when the robot has a misspecified model of the features that the human cares about or the level of rationality of the human.

A CIRL problem is a cooperative, partial-information game with two agents, human and robot; both are rewarded according to the human's reward function, but the robot does not initially know what this is. In contrast to classical IRL, where the human is assumed to act optimally in isolation, optimal CIRL solutions produce behaviors such as active teaching, active learning, and communicative actions that are more effective in achieving value alignment.

In each case, observations of people's past choices can inform our inferences about their likes and preferences. If we assume that choices are approximately optimal according to some utility function, we can treat preference inference as Bayesian inverse planning. That is, given a prior on utility functions and some observed choices, we invert an optimal decision-making process to infer a posterior distribution on utility functions. However, people often deviate from approximate optimality. They have false beliefs, their planning is sub-optimal, and their choices may be temporally inconsistent due to hyperbolic discounting and other biases. We demonstrate how to incorporate these deviations into algorithms for preference inference by constructing generative models of planning for agents who are subject to false beliefs and time inconsistency. We explore the inferences these models make about preferences, beliefs, and biases.

In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (""wordpieces"") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of ""character""-delimited models and the efficiency of ""word""-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60% compared to Google's phrase-based production system.",2016-10-08,2022-03-11 0:46:23,2022-03-11 0:46:23,2022-03-11 0:46:23,,,,,,,Google's Neural Machine Translation System,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 1609.08144,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/NE29WJV2/Wu et al. - 2016 - Google's Neural Machine Translation System Bridgi.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/UWQ7F2HF/1609.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice.

Business users often make decisions to achieve key performance indicators (KPIs) such as increasing customer retention or sales, or decreasing costs. To discover the relationship between data attributes hypothesized to be drivers and those corresponding to KPIs of interest, business users currently need to perform lengthy exploratory analyses. This involves considering multitudes of combinations and scenarios and performing slicing, dicing, and transformations on the data accordingly, e.g., analyzing customer retention across quarters of the year or suggesting optimal media channels across strata of customers. However, the increasing complexity of datasets combined with the cognitive limitations of humans makes it challenging to carry over multiple hypotheses, even for simple datasets. Therefore mentally performing such analyses is hard. Existing commercial tools either provide partial solutions or fail to cater to business users altogether. Here we argue for four functionalities to enable business users to interactively learn and reason about the relationships between sets of data attributes thereby facilitating data-driven decision making. We implement these functionalities in SystemD, an interactive visual data analysis system enabling business users to experiment with the data by asking what-if questions. We evaluate the system through three business use cases: marketing mix modeling, customer retention analysis, and deal closing analysis, and report on feedback from multiple business users. Users find the SystemD functionalities highly useful for quick testing and validation of their hypotheses around their KPIs of interest, addressing their unmet analysis needs. The feedback also suggests that the UX design can be enhanced to further improve the understandability of these functionalities.",2022-02-08,2022-03-11 0:54:22,2022-03-11 0:54:22,2022-03-11 0:54:22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2109.06160,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/AX2U4F9X/Gathani et al. - 2022 - Augmenting Decision Making via Interactive What-If.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/HBYRB7W9/2109.html,,,Computer Science - Databases; Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction; Computer Science - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the key challenges is that models lack supervision signals from unknown data, and as a result, can produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. Previous approaches rely on real outlier datasets for model regularization, which can be costly and sometimes infeasible to obtain in practice. In this paper, we present VOS, a novel framework for OOD detection by adaptively synthesizing virtual outliers that can meaningfully regularize the model's decision boundary during training. Specifically, VOS samples virtual outliers from the low-likelihood region of the class-conditional distribution estimated in the feature space. Alongside, we introduce a novel unknown-aware training objective, which contrastively shapes the uncertainty space between the ID data and synthesized outlier data.

We address this tension by introducing a simple and effective method for improving robustness while fine-tuning: ensembling the weights of the zero-shot and fine-tuned models (WiSE-FT). Compared to standard fine-tuning, WiSE-FT provides large accuracy improvements under distribution shift, while preserving high accuracy on the target distribution. On ImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, WiSE-FT improves accuracy under distribution shift by 4 to 6 percentage points (pp) over prior work while increasing ImageNet accuracy by 1.6 pp. WiSE-FT achieves similarly large robustness gains (2 to 23 pp) on a diverse set of six further distribution shifts, and accuracy gains of 0.8 to 3.3 pp compared to standard fine-tuning on seven commonly used transfer learning datasets.

We study the problem of test time robustification, i.e., using the test input to improve model robustness. Recent prior works have proposed methods for test time adaptation, however, they each introduce additional assumptions, such as access to multiple test points, that prevent widespread adoption. In this work, we aim to study and devise methods that make no assumptions about the model training process and are broadly applicable at test time. We propose a simple approach that can be used in any test setting where the model is probabilistic and adaptable: when presented with a test example, perform different data augmentations on the data point, and then adapt (all of) the model parameters by minimizing the entropy of the model's average, or marginal, output distribution across the augmentations. Intuitively, this objective encourages the model to make the same prediction across different augmentations, thus enforcing the invariances encoded in these augmentations, while also maintaining confidence in its predictions. In our experiments, we evaluate two baseline ResNet models, two robust ResNet-50 models, and a robust vision transformer model, and we demonstrate that this approach achieves accuracy gains of 1-8\% over standard model evaluation and also generally outperforms prior augmentation and adaptation strategies.

As a result, ViTs fail to generalize to out-of-distribution, real-world data. To address this deficiency, we present a simple and effective architecture modification to ViT's input layer by adding discrete tokens produced by a vector-quantized encoder. Different from the standard continuous pixel tokens, discrete tokens are invariant under small perturbations and contain less information individually, which promote ViTs to learn global information that is invariant.

Such data-driven optimization procedures are the only practical methods in many real-world domains where active data collection is expensive (e.g., when optimizing over proteins) or dangerous (e.g., when optimizing over aircraft designs). Typical methods for MBO that optimize the design against a learned model suffer from distributional shift: it is easy to find a design that ""fools"" the model into predicting a high value. To overcome this, we propose conservative objective models (COMs), a method that learns a model of the objective function that lower bounds the actual value of the ground-truth objective on out-of-distribution inputs, and uses it for optimization. Structurally, COMs resemble adversarial training methods used to overcome adversarial examples.

Intuitively, pairs of events that are always observed in the same order are likely to be separated by an irreversible sequence of actions. Conveniently, learning the temporal order of events can be done in a fully self-supervised way, which we use to estimate the reversibility of actions from experience, without any priors. We propose two different strategies that incorporate reversibility in RL agents, one strategy for exploration (RAE) and one strategy for control (RAC).

Existing approaches use images of unexpected objects from external datasets or require additional training (e.g., retraining segmentation networks or training an extra network), which necessitate a non-trivial amount of labor intensity or lengthy inference time. One possible alternative is to use prediction scores of a pre-trained network such as the max logits (i.e., maximum values among classes before the final softmax layer) for detecting such objects. However, the distribution of max logits of each predicted class is significantly different from each other, which degrades the performance of identifying unexpected objects in urban-scene segmentation. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach that standardizes the max logits in order to align the different distributions and reflect the relative meanings of max logits within each predicted class. Moreover, we consider the local regions from two different perspectives based on the intuition that neighboring pixels share similar semantic information.

One widely used approach towards this goal is to visualize unit responses via activation maximization. These synthetic feature visualizations are purported to provide humans with precise information about the image features that cause a unit to be activated - an advantage over other alternatives like strongly activating natural dataset samples. If humans indeed gain causal insight from visualizations, this should enable them to predict the effect of an intervention, such as how occluding a certain patch of the image (say, a dog's head) changes a unit's activation. Here, we test this hypothesis by asking humans to decide which of two square occlusions causes a larger change to a unit's activation. Both a large-scale crowdsourced experiment and measurements with experts show that on average the extremely activating feature visualizations by Olah et al. (2017) indeed help humans on this task ($68 \pm 4$% accuracy; baseline performance without any visualizations is $60 \pm 3$%). However, they do not provide any substantial advantage over other visualizations (such as e.g. dataset samples), which yield similar performance ($66\pm3$% to $67 \pm3$% accuracy).

One reason is that existing robustness benchmarks are limited, as they either rely on synthetic data or they simply measure robustness as generalization between datasets and hence ignore the effects of individual nuisance factors. In this work, we introduce ROBIN, a benchmark dataset for diagnosing the robustness of vision algorithms to individual nuisances in real-world images. ROBIN builds on 10 rigid categories from the PASCAL VOC 2012 and ImageNet datasets and includes out-of-distribution examples of the objects 3D pose, shape, texture, context and weather conditions. ROBIN is richly annotated to enable benchmark models for image classification, object detection, and 3D pose estimation. We provide results for a number of popular baselines and make several interesting observations: 1. Some nuisance factors have a much stronger negative effect on the performance compared to others. Moreover, the negative effect of an OODnuisance depends on the downstream vision task. 2. Current approaches to enhance OOD robustness using strong data augmentation have only marginal effects in real-world OOD scenarios, and sometimes even reduce the OOD performance. 3.

However, recent studies reveal that the robustness of these models can be challenged by carefully crafted textual adversarial examples. While several individual datasets have been proposed to evaluate model robustness, a principled and comprehensive benchmark is still missing. In this paper, we present Adversarial GLUE (AdvGLUE), a new multi-task benchmark to quantitatively and thoroughly explore and evaluate the vulnerabilities of modern large-scale language models under various types of adversarial attacks. In particular, we systematically apply 14 textual adversarial attack methods to GLUE tasks to construct AdvGLUE, which is further validated by humans for reliable annotations. Our findings are summarized as follows. (i) Most existing adversarial attack algorithms are prone to generating invalid or ambiguous adversarial examples, with around 90% of them either changing the original semantic meanings or misleading human annotators as well. Therefore, we perform a careful filtering process to curate a high-quality benchmark.

Dynamic adversarial data collection (DADC), where annotators craft examples that challenge continually improving models, holds promise as an approach for generating such diverse training sets. Prior work has shown that running DADC over 1-3 rounds can help models fix some error types, but it does not necessarily lead to better generalization beyond adversarial test data. We argue that running DADC over many rounds maximizes its training-time benefits, as the different rounds can together cover many of the task-relevant phenomena. We present the first study of longer-term DADC, where we collect 20 rounds of NLI examples for a small set of premise paragraphs, with both adversarial and non-adversarial approaches. Models trained on DADC examples make 26% fewer errors on our expert-curated test set compared to models trained on non-adversarial data.

Such specifications demand domain expertise, limiting the adoption of safe RL. In this paper, we propose learning to interpret natural language constraints for safe RL. To this end, we first introduce HazardWorld, a new multi-task benchmark that requires an agent to optimize reward while not violating constraints specified in free-form text. We then develop an agent with a modular architecture that can interpret and adhere to such textual constraints while learning new tasks. Our model consists of (1) a constraint interpreter that encodes textual constraints into spatial and temporal representations of forbidden states, and (2) a policy network that uses these representations to produce a policy achieving minimal constraint violations during training. Across different domains in HazardWorld, we show that our method achieves higher rewards (up to11x) and fewer constraint violations (by 1.8x) compared to existing approaches.

Since we do not assume any prior knowledge or pre-training of the safety concept, we are interested in asymptotic constraint satisfaction. A popular approach in this line of research is to combine the Lagrangian method with a model-free RL algorithm to adjust the weight of the constraint reward dynamically. It relies on a single policy to handle the conflict between utility and constraint rewards, which is often challenging. Inspired by the safety layer design (Dalal et al., 2018), we propose to separately learn a safety editor policy that transforms potentially unsafe actions output by a utility maximizer policy into safe ones. The safety editor is trained to maximize the constraint reward while minimizing a hinge loss of the utility Q values of actions before and after the edit. On 12 custom Safety Gym (Ray et al., 2019) tasks and 2 safe racing tasks with very harsh constraint thresholds, our approach demonstrates outstanding utility performance while complying with the constraints. Ablation studies reveal that our two-policy design is critical. Simply doubling the model capacity of typical single-policy approaches will not lead to comparable results. The Q hinge loss is also important in certain circumstances, and replacing it with the usual L2 distance could fail badly.",2022-01-28,2022-03-11 1:03:18,2022-03-11 1:38:19,2022-03-11 1:03:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,arXiv: 2201.12427,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9C9VJF2I/Yu et al. - 2022 - Towards Safe Reinforcement Learning with a Safety .pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/IK4X6IGS/Yu et al. - 2022 - Towards Safe Reinforcement Learning with a Safety .pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/LIDV2Y77/2201.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/SL4D3MH8/2201.html,,,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Robotics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preference-based RL provides an alternative: learning policies using a teacher's preferences without pre-defined rewards, thus overcoming concerns associated with reward engineering. However, it is difficult to quantify the progress in preference-based RL due to the lack of a commonly adopted benchmark. In this paper, we introduce B-Pref: a benchmark specially designed for preference-based RL. A key challenge with such a benchmark is providing the ability to evaluate candidate algorithms quickly, which makes relying on real human input for evaluation prohibitive. At the same time, simulating human input as giving perfect preferences for the ground truth reward function is unrealistic. B-Pref alleviates this by simulating teachers with a wide array of irrationalities, and proposes metrics not solely for performance but also for robustness to these potential irrationalities. We showcase the utility of B-Pref by using it to analyze algorithmic design choices, such as selecting informative queries, for state-of-the-art preference-based RL algorithms. We hope that B-Pref can serve as a common starting point to study preference-based RL more systematically.

In this work, we propose a new approach: we measure the performance of a collection of models when evaluated on a $\textit{single input point}$. Specifically, we study a point's $\textit{profile}$: the relationship between models' average performance on the test distribution and their pointwise performance on this individual point. We find that profiles can yield new insights into the structure of both models and data -- in and out-of-distribution. For example, we empirically show that real data distributions consist of points with qualitatively different profiles. On one hand, there are ""compatible"" points with strong correlation between the pointwise and average performance. On the other hand, there are points with weak and even $\textit{negative}$ correlation: cases where improving overall model accuracy actually $\textit{hurts}$ performance on these inputs. We prove that these experimental observations are inconsistent with the predictions of several simplified models of learning proposed in prior work. As an application, we use profiles to construct a dataset we call CIFAR-10-NEG: a subset of CINIC-10 such that for standard models, accuracy on CIFAR-10-NEG is $\textit{negatively correlated}$ with accuracy on CIFAR-10 test.

However, existing techniques either make strong assumptions on the model class and loss functions that can be certified, such as smoothness expressed via Lipschitz continuity of gradients, or require to solve complex optimization problems. As a result, the wider application of these techniques is currently limited by its scalability and flexibility -- these techniques often do not scale to large-scale datasets with modern deep neural networks or cannot handle loss functions which may be non-smooth, such as the 0-1 loss. In this paper, we focus on the problem of certifying distributional robustness for black box models and bounded losses, without other assumptions. We propose a novel certification framework given bounded distance of mean and variance of two distributions. Our certification technique scales to ImageNet-scale datasets, complex models, and a diverse range of loss functions. We then focus on one specific application enabled by such scalability and flexibility, i.e., certifying out-of-domain generalization for large neural networks and loss functions such as accuracy and AUC.

Our analysis demonstrates a previously unknown vulnerability of these models to low-frequency OOD data such as weather-related corruptions, rendering these models unfit for deployment in the wild. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel data augmentation scheme, FourierMix, that produces augmentations to improve the spectral coverage of the training data. Furthermore, we propose a new regularizer that encourages consistent predictions on noise perturbations of the augmented data to improve the quality of the smoothed models. We find that FourierMix augmentations help eliminate the spectral bias of certifiably robust models enabling them to achieve significantly better robustness guarantees on a range of OOD benchmarks. Our evaluation also uncovers the inability of current OOD benchmarks at highlighting the spectral biases of the models. To this end, we propose a comprehensive benchmarking suite that contains corruptions from different regions in the spectral domain.

Since machines powered by artificial intelligence are playing an ever greater role in our lives, it will be important to equip them with the capabilities necessary to cooperate and to foster cooperation. We see an opportunity for the field of artificial intelligence to explicitly focus effort on this class of problems, which we term Cooperative AI. The objective of this research would be to study the many aspects of the problems of cooperation and to innovate in AI to contribute to solving these problems. Central goals include building machine agents with the capabilities needed for cooperation, building tools to foster cooperation in populations of (machine and/or human) agents, and otherwise conducting AI research for insight relevant to problems of cooperation. This research integrates ongoing work on multi-agent systems, game theory and social choice, human-machine interaction and alignment, natural-language processing, and the construction of social tools and platforms. However, Cooperative AI is not the union of these existing areas, but rather an independent bet about the productivity of specific kinds of conversations that involve these and other areas.

We address a fully general setting, in which the (stochastic) environment and demonstrator never reset, not even for training purposes. Our new conservative Bayesian imitation learner underestimates the probabilities of each available action, and queries for more data with the remaining probability.

This approach is intended to provide value for a principal: the user on whose behalf the agent acts. The objectives given to these agents often refer to a partial specification of the principal's goals. We consider the cost of this incompleteness by analyzing a model of a principal and an agent in a resource constrained world where the $L$ attributes of the state correspond to different sources of utility for the principal. We assume that the reward function given to the agent only has support on $J < L$ attributes. The contributions of our paper are as follows: 1) we propose a novel model of an incomplete principal-agent problem from artificial intelligence; 2) we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which indefinitely optimizing for any incomplete proxy objective leads to arbitrarily low overall utility; and 3) we show how modifying the setup to allow reward functions that reference the full state or allowing the principal to update the proxy objective over time can lead to higher utility solutions. The results in this paper argue that we should view the design of reward functions as an interactive and dynamic process and identifies a theoretical scenario where some degree of interactivity is desirable.,2021-02-07,2022-03-11 1:26:50,2022-03-11 1:26:50,2022-03-11 1:26:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arxiv.org,,,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/6D3TAWRW/Zhuang and Hadfield-Menell - 2021 - Consequences of Misaligned AI.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/AB3SPPGB/2102.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, these systems are now being incorporated into commercial products. With this comes an additional challenge: how can we build AI systems that solve tasks where there is not a crisp, well-defined specification? While multiple solutions have been proposed, in this competition we focus on one in particular: learning from human feedback. Rather than training AI systems using a predefined reward function or using a labeled dataset with a predefined set of categories, we instead train the AI system using a learning signal derived from some form of human feedback, which can evolve over time as the understanding of the task changes, or as the capabilities of the AI system improve. The MineRL BASALT competition aims to spur forward research on this important class of techniques. We design a suite of four tasks in Minecraft for which we expect it will be hard to write down hardcoded reward functions. These tasks are defined by a paragraph of natural language: for example, ""create a waterfall and take a scenic picture of it"", with additional clarifying details. Participants must train a separate agent for each task, using any method they want. Agents are then evaluated by humans who have read the task description. To help participants get started, we provide a dataset of human demonstrations on each of the four tasks, as well as an imitation learning baseline that leverages these demonstrations. Our hope is that this competition will improve our ability to build AI systems that do what their designers intend them to do, even when the intent cannot be easily formalized.

However, such approaches are impeded by the expense of acquiring such feedback. Recent work proposed that agents have access to a source of information that is effectively free: in any environment that humans have acted in, the state will already be optimized for human preferences, and thus an agent can extract information about what humans want from the state. Such learning is possible in principle, but requires simulating all possible past trajectories that could have led to the observed state. This is feasible in gridworlds, but how do we scale it to complex tasks? In this work, we show that by combining a learned feature encoder with learned inverse models, we can enable agents to simulate human actions backwards in time to infer what they must have done.

This means that we must not only specify what to do, but also the much larger space of what not to do. It is easy to forget these preferences, since these preferences are already satisfied in our environment. This motivates our key insight: when a robot is deployed in an environment that humans act in, the state of the environment is already optimized for what humans want. We can therefore use this implicit preference information from the state to fill in the blanks. We develop an algorithm based on Maximum Causal Entropy IRL and use it to evaluate the idea in a suite of proof-of-concept environments designed to show its properties.

In this work, we aim to make this process more sample- and feedback-efficient. We present an off-policy, interactive RL algorithm that capitalizes on the strengths of both feedback and off-policy learning. Specifically, we learn a reward model by actively querying a teacher's preferences between two clips of behavior and use it to train an agent. To enable off-policy learning, we relabel all the agent's past experience when its reward model changes. We additionally show that pre-training our agents with unsupervised exploration substantially increases the mileage of its queries. We demonstrate that our approach is capable of learning tasks of higher complexity than previously considered by human-in-the-loop methods, including a variety of locomotion and robotic manipulation skills.

These norms entail that the relevant AI systems must meet a certain standard of public justification, support citizens rights, and promote substantively fair outcomes -- something that requires specific attention be paid to the impact they have on the worst-off members of society.",2021-10-27,2022-03-11 1:27:30,2022-03-11 1:27:30,2022-03-11 1:27:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arxiv.org,,,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/GLV244ND/Gabriel - 2021 - Towards a Theory of Justice for Artificial Intelli.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/6RN8GS45/2110.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Namely, these generative models have an unusual combination of predictable loss on a broad training distribution (as embodied in their ""scaling laws""), and unpredictable specific capabilities, inputs, and outputs. We believe that the high-level predictability and appearance of useful capabilities drives rapid development of such models, while the unpredictable qualities make it difficult to anticipate the consequences of model deployment. We go through examples of how this combination can lead to socially harmful behavior with examples from the literature and real world observations, and we also perform two novel experiments to illustrate our point about harms from unpredictability.

While lying has traditionally been a human affair, AI systems that make sophisticated verbal statements are becoming increasingly prevalent. This raises the question of how we should limit the harm caused by AI ""lies"" (i.e. falsehoods that are actively selected for). Human truthfulness is governed by social norms and by laws (against defamation, perjury, and fraud). Differences between AI and humans present an opportunity to have more precise standards of truthfulness for AI, and to have these standards rise over time. This could provide significant benefits to public epistemics and the economy, and mitigate risks of worst-case AI futures. Establishing norms or laws of AI truthfulness will require significant work to: (1) identify clear truthfulness standards; (2) create institutions that can judge adherence to those standards; and (3) develop AI systems that are robustly truthful. Our initial proposals for these areas include: (1) a standard of avoiding ""negligent falsehoods"" (a generalisation of lies that is easier to assess); (2) institutions to evaluate AI systems before and after real-world deployment; and (3) explicitly training AI systems to be truthful via curated datasets and human interaction. A concerning possibility is that evaluation mechanisms for eventual truthfulness standards could be captured by political interests, leading to harmful censorship and propaganda.

While broad ethical rules may seem straightforward to state (""thou shalt not kill""), applying such rules to real-world situations is far more complex. For example, while ""helping a friend"" is generally a good thing to do, ""helping a friend spread fake news"" is not. We identify four underlying challenges towards machine ethics and norms: (1) an understanding of moral precepts and social norms; (2) the ability to perceive real-world situations visually or by reading natural language descriptions; (3) commonsense reasoning to anticipate the outcome of alternative actions in different contexts; (4) most importantly, the ability to make ethical judgments given the interplay between competing values and their grounding in different contexts (e.g., the right to freedom of expression vs. preventing the spread of fake news). Our paper begins to address these questions within the deep learning paradigm. Our prototype model, Delphi, demonstrates strong promise of language-based commonsense moral reasoning, with up to 92.1% accuracy vetted by humans. This is in stark contrast to the zero-shot performance of GPT-3 of 52.3%, which suggests that massive scale alone does not endow pre-trained neural language models with human values. Thus, we present Commonsense Norm Bank, a moral textbook customized for machines, which compiles 1.7M examples of people's ethical judgments on a broad spectrum of everyday situations.

We hypothesize that these failures to robustly generalize are due to the learning systems retaining too much information about the training data. To test this hypothesis, we propose the Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) criterion for evaluating the quality of a model. In order to train models that perform well with respect to the MNI criterion, we present a new objective function, the Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB), which is closely related to the Information Bottleneck (IB).

One potential problem with deep learning is that there might be too _much_ information in the input, causing the model to learn spurious correlations that do not actually generalize well (see <@Causal Confusion in Imitation Learning@> as an example). The idea with CEB is to penalize the model for learning irrelevant information, using a form of _information bottleneck_.

We consider a setting where we want to learn a representation **Z** of some input data **X** in order to predict some downstream data **Y**. In CPC, **X** would be the inputs from time 1 to t, **Z** would be the latent representation **z_t**, and **Y** would be the future data **x_{t+k}**. Then, we want **Z** to capture the **minimum necessary information** needed for **Z** to predict **Y** as best as possible. The _necessary_ information is **I(Y; Z)**, that is, the mutual information between **Z** and **Y**: we want to maximize this to maximize our accuracy at predicting **Y**. Since **Y** depends on **X** and **Z** is computed from **X**, any information about **Y** must come through mutual information between **X** and **Z**. Maximizing just this **I(Y; Z)** term gives us Contrastive Predictive Coding.

However, we don't want to capture any extra irrelevant information (the minimality criterion), which means that **Z** shouldn't capture any _more_ information about **X** beyond what it captured to maximize **I(Y; Z)**. In information-theoretic terms, we want to _minimize_ **I(X; Z | Y)**. Thus, we have the CEB objective: minimizing **I(X; Z | Y) - γ I(Y; Z)**, where **γ** is a hyperparameter controlling the tradeoff between the two terms. The authors then use some fairly straightforward math to reduce the objective to simpler terms which can be bounded using variational approximations, leading to an algorithm that can work in practice.

The authors perform experiments on Fashion MNIST and CIFAR10 (where Y corresponds to the labels for the images, so we're in the supervised learning setting). Since the main benefit of CEB is to remove unnecessary information from the model, they evaluate adversarial robustness and out-of-distribution detection in addition to standard performance checks. They find that models trained with CEB perform better than ones trained with a variational information bottleneck, or ones trained with vanilla SGD."

The authors use an example on MNIST in which the network learns to classify the numbers 1 and 7 in an almost discrete fashion during particular epochs to compare different methods for visualizing how the dataset is classified. They find that one problem with nonlinear dimensionality reduction like t-SNE and UMAPs is that changes to a subset of the dataset can strongly affect how unchanged data points are represented. Then they compare this to the Grand Tour, a classical technique that projects the data into two dimensions from varying points of view. As projections are linear in the input variables, it is rather easy to reason about how changes in the data affect this visualization and the times the classes 1 and 7 are learnt are indeed quite salient in their example. Another advantage of this method is that confusion between two specific classes can be identified more easily, as the corresponding data points will be projected onto the line connecting the clusters for these classes. A similar approach can be taken on a network's hidden layers to identify the layer in which different classes become clearly distinguishable. They find that they can identify adversarial examples generated by FGSM by looking at the second to last layer, where the adversarial examples form a cluster distinct from the real images.

As the Grand Tour involves varying rotations, it is basically unaffected by rotations of the data. The authors argue that this is a feature, as rotations are small changes to the data and should not have a large effect on the visualization."

This game is procedurally generated, which means the levels are different in every episode of playing. The interface primarily uses attribution from a hidden layer to the output of the value function. This interface is used in several ways.

First, they use the interface to dissect failed trajectories of the policy (it fails in 1 out of 200 levels). They're able to understand why the failures occurred using their interface: for example, in one case the view of the agent at the top of its jump means it can't see any platforms below it, so doesn't move to the right fast enough to reach the platform it was jumping for, leading it to miss the platform and fail the level. Second, they use the interface to discover ""hallucinations"", where the value function mistakes one element of the environment for another, causing its value to drop or rise significantly. Often these hallucinations only last a single time-step, so they don't affect performance.

Finally, they use the attributions specifically to hand-edit the weights of the model to make it ""blind"" to buzzsaws (one of the hazards) by zeroing the feature which recognises them. After doing this, they show that the edited agent fails a lot more from buzzsaw failures but no more from other types of failures, which gives a quantitative justification for their interpretation of the feature as buzzsaw-recognising.

From using this interface, they propose the **diversity hypothesis:** _Interpretable features tend to arise (at a given level of abstraction) if and only if the training distribution is diverse enough (at that level of abstraction)._ This is based on the fact that interpretable features arise more when the agent is trained on a wider variety of levels. There also seems to be a qualitative link to generalisation - a wider distribution of training levels leads to better interpretability (measured qualitatively) and better generalisation (measured quantitatively)."

A natural first approach toward safe RL is to manually specify constraints on the policy's behavior. However, just as learning has enabled progress in large-scale development of AI systems, learning safety specifications may also be necessary to ensure safety in messy open-world environments where manual safety specifications cannot scale. Akin to how humans learn incrementally starting in child-safe environments, we propose to learn how to be safe in one set of tasks and environments, and then use that learned intuition to constrain future behaviors when learning new, modified tasks. We empirically study this form of safety-constrained transfer learning in three challenging domains: simulated navigation, quadruped locomotion, and dexterous in-hand manipulation. In comparison to standard deep RL techniques and prior approaches to safe RL, we find that our method enables the learning of new tasks and in new environments with both substantially fewer safety incidents, such as falling or dropping an object, and faster, more stable learning. This suggests a path forward not only for safer RL systems, but also for more effective RL systems.",2020-10-27,2022-01-30 4:48:46,2022-01-30 4:48:46,2021-11-13 14:06:18,,,,,,,Learning to be Safe,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000022  arXiv: 2010.14603,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/GDXUUMCR/Srinivasan et al. - 2020 - Learning to be Safe Deep RL with a Safety Critic.pdf,,UnsortedSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Robotics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper argues that neither of those criteria are certain of Deep Neural Networks. First, highly touted AI successes (eg. image classification and speech recognition) are orders of magnitude more failure-prone than are typically certified in critical systems even within design bounds (perfectly in-distribution sampling). Second, performance falls off only gradually as inputs become further Out-Of-Distribution (OOD).

This behavior is not captured by classical generalization, which would only consider the average error and not the distribution of errors over the input domain. Our formal conjectures, which are much more general than this example, characterize the form of distributional generalization that can be expected in terms of problem parameters: model architecture, training procedure, number of samples, and data distribution.

This simple theory predicts that the scaling exponents $\alpha \approx 4/d$ for cross-entropy and mean-squared error losses. We confirm the theory by independently measuring the intrinsic dimension and the scaling exponents in a teacher/student framework, where we can study a variety of $d$ and $\alpha$ by dialing the properties of random teacher networks.

To do so, we first trained a model to predict responses of face-selective neurons in macaque inferior temporal cortex. Next, we modified images, such as human faces, to match their model-predicted neuronal responses to a target category, such as monkey faces.

This outcome is however not guaranteed: a myopic focus on short-term benefits could lock AI into technologies that turn out to be sub-optimal in the longer-run. Recent controversies about the dominance of deep learning methods and private labs in AI research suggest that the field may be getting narrower, but the evidence base is lacking. We seek to address this gap with an analysis of the thematic diversity of AI research in arXiv, a widely used pre-prints site. Having identified 110,000 AI papers in this corpus, we use hierarchical topic modelling to estimate the thematic composition of AI research, and this composition to calculate various metrics of research diversity. Our analysis suggests that diversity in AI research has stagnated in recent years, and that AI research involving private sector organisations tends to be less diverse than research in academia. This appears to be driven by a small number of prolific and narrowly-focused technology companies. Diversity in academia is bolstered by smaller institutions and research groups that may have less incentives to race and lower levels of collaboration with the private sector. We also find that private sector AI researchers tend to specialise in data and computationally intensive deep learning methods at the expense of research involving other (symbolic and statistical) AI methods, and of research that considers the societal and ethical implications of AI or applies it in domains like health. Our results suggest that there may be a rationale for policy action to prevent a premature narrowing of AI research that could reduce its societal benefits, but we note the incentive, information and scale hurdles standing in the way of such interventions.",2020-11-17,2022-01-30 4:48:43,2022-01-30 4:48:43,2021-11-13 21:54:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000017  arXiv: 2009.10385,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/R7VVT4NZ/Klinger et al. - 2020 - A narrowing of AI research.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/KZJD9H3Z/2009.html,,UnsortedSafety,Computer Science - Computers and Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Absent significant advances in reward learning, it is thus important to be able to audit learned reward functions to verify whether they truly capture user preferences. In this paper, we investigate techniques for interpreting learned reward functions. In particular, we apply saliency methods to identify failure modes and predict the robustness of reward functions.

Assuming the players have reached common knowledge of their situation, this paper derives a recursion that any Pareto optimal policy must satisfy. Two qualitative observations can be made from the recursion: the machine must (1) use each player's own beliefs in evaluating how well an action will serve that player's utility function, and (2) shift the relative priority it assigns to each player's expected utilities over time, by a factor proportional to how well that player's beliefs predict the machine's inputs.

The agents' decision-making is transparent to each other, which allows each agent to predict how their opponent will play against them. To prevent an infinite regress of both agents recursively predicting each other indefinitely, each agent is required to give an opponent-independent response with some probability at least epsilon. Transparency also allows each agent to anticipate and shape the other agent's gradient step, i.e. to move to regions of parameter space in which the opponent's gradient points in a direction favourable to them. We study the resulting dynamics experimentally, using two algorithms from previous literature (LOLA and SOS) for opponent-aware learning. We find that the combination of mutually transparent decision-making and opponent-aware learning robustly leads to mutual cooperation in a single-shot prisoner's dilemma. In a game of chicken, in which both agents try to manoeuvre their opponent towards their preferred equilibrium, converging to a mutually beneficial outcome turns out to be much harder, and opponent-aware learning can even lead to worst-case outcomes for both agents. This highlights the need to develop opponent-aware learning algorithms that achieve acceptable outcomes in social dilemmas involving an equilibrium selection problem.",2020-12-04,2022-01-30 4:51:08,2022-01-30 4:51:08,2020-12-12 15:01:23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000000  arXiv: 2012.02671,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/EFFXSWJA/Hutter - 2020 - Learning in two-player games between transparent o.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/U9M27NJU/2012.html,,CLR; TechSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Policies, such as human, or policies on deployed robots, can all be cloned without consent from the owners. How can we protect against external observers cloning our proprietary policies? To answer this question we introduce a new reinforcement learning framework, where we train an ensemble of near-optimal policies, whose demonstrations are guaranteed to be useless for an external observer. We formulate this idea by a constrained optimization problem, where the objective is to improve proprietary policies, and at the same time deteriorate the virtual policy of an eventual external observer. We design a tractable algorithm to solve this new optimization problem by modifying the standard policy gradient algorithm. Our formulation can be interpreted in lenses of confidentiality and adversarial behaviour, which enables a broader perspective of this work. We demonstrate the existence of ""non-clonable"" ensembles, providing a solution to the above optimization problem, which is calculated by our modified policy gradient algorithm.

We identify underspecification as a key reason for these failures. An ML pipeline is underspecified when it can return many predictors with equivalently strong held-out performance in the training domain. Underspecification is common in modern ML pipelines, such as those based on deep learning. Predictors returned by underspecified pipelines are often treated as equivalent based on their training domain performance, but we show here that such predictors can behave very differently in deployment domains. This ambiguity can lead to instability and poor model behavior in practice, and is a distinct failure mode from previously identified issues arising from structural mismatch between training and deployment domains. We show that this problem appears in a wide variety of practical ML pipelines, using examples from computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, clinical risk prediction based on electronic health records, and medical genomics.

ZSEVCJIG,manuscript,2019,"Gruetzemacher, Ross; Whittlestone, Jess",The Transformative Potential of Artificial Intelligence,,,,,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00747,"Recently the concept of transformative AI (TAI) has begun to receive attention in the AI policy space. TAI is often framed as an alternative formulation to notions of strong AI (e.g. artificial general intelligence or superintelligence) and reflects increasing consensus that advanced AI which does not fit these definitions may nonetheless have extreme and long-lasting impacts on society. However, the term TAI is poorly defined and often used ambiguously. Some use the notion of TAI to describe levels of societal transformation associated with previous 'general purpose technologies' (GPTs) such as electricity or the internal combustion engine. Others use the term to refer to more drastic levels of transformation comparable to the agricultural or industrial revolutions. The notion has also been used much more loosely, with some implying that current AI systems are already having a transformative impact on society. This paper unpacks and analyses the notion of TAI, proposing a distinction between narrowly transformative AI (NTAI), TAI and radically transformative AI (RTAI), roughly corresponding to associated levels of societal change. We describe some relevant dimensions associated with each and discuss what kinds of advances in capabilities they might require. We further consider the relationship between TAI and RTAI and whether we should necessarily expect a period of TAI to precede the emergence of RTAI. This analysis is important as it can help guide discussions among AI policy researchers about how to allocate resources towards mitigating the most extreme impacts of AI and it can bring attention to negative TAI scenarios that are currently neglected.",2019,2022-01-30 4:50:26,2022-01-30 4:50:26,2020-11-14 0:55:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s1]  ACC: 6  arXiv: 1912.00747,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/SD4BQGGF/Gruetzemacher and Whittlestone - 2020 - The Transformative Potential of Artificial Intelli.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/F5KGIKR2/1912.html,,MetaSafety; CFI; CSER; AmbiguosSafety; BERI,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computers and Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are not arguing for any specific approach on when or how research should be distributed, but instead try to lay out some useful tools, analogies, and options for thinking about these issues. We begin with some background on the idea that ML research might be misused in harmful ways, and why advances in synthetic media, in particular, are raising concerns. We then outline in more detail some of the different paths to harm from ML research, before reviewing research risk mitigation strategies in other fields and identifying components that seem most worth emulating in the ML and synthetic media research communities. Next, we outline some important dimensions of disagreement on these issues which risk polarizing conversations. Finally, we conclude with recommendations, suggesting that the machine learning community might benefit from: working with subject matter experts to increase understanding of the risk landscape and possible mitigation strategies; building a community and norms around understanding the impacts of ML research, e.g. through regular workshops at major conferences; and establishing institutions and systems to support release practices that would otherwise be onerous and error-prone.",2019-07-28,2022-01-30 4:50:25,2022-01-30 4:50:25,2019-12-16 22:39:38,,,,,,,Reducing malicious use of synthetic media research,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000012  arXiv: 1907.11274,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9JS2GGPU/Ovadya and Whittlestone - 2019 - Reducing malicious use of synthetic media research.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/DX2WMWTT/Ovadya and Whittlestone - 2019 - Reducing malicious use of synthetic media research.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/R2ETWS25/1907.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/ADSVSN46/1907.html,,MetaSafety; CFI; CSER; AmbiguosSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Computers and Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first is provable safety envelopes, which are possible only when the dynamics of the system are fully known, but can be useful safety guarantees when optimal behavior is based on machine learning with poorly-understood safety characteristics. The second is the simpler circuit breaker model, which can forestall or prevent catastrophic outcomes by stopping the system, without any specific model of the system. This paper proposes using heuristic, dynamic safety envelopes, which are a plausible halfway point between these approaches that allows human oversight without some of the more difficult problems faced by Human-in-the-Loop systems.

However, there is little interaction between these domains, and no unifying theoretical framework forcing the delineation of assumptions. I propose such a framework in terms of agent-environment systems, in which an agent and environment co-evolve according to a modiﬁed statespace nonlinear system. The agent gathers limited information from the environment and itself to perform an action, operating implicitly on the basis of a coarse-grained model of the systems dynamics. To ensure the systems safety, it is minimally necessary ﬁrst to translate the set of undesirable states from human terms into an adequately precise deﬁnition within the system; then to identify a set of universal markers necessary to the system being in a pre-state to an undesirable state, which transfer with ﬁdelity from the systems state to the agents information; and ﬁnally to have a set of actions by the agent for each pre-state which keep the system out of the set of undesirable states, with the exception of agent-independent dynamics. Incomplete information, information distortion, and coarse-grained models make this a particularly difﬁcult challenge. I conclude by proposing three threads of a research agenda: reducing the possibility space of safe agents by demonstrating the failure of certain methods and identifying problems with particular agent-environment system classes; developing and verifying techniques which address those problems; and matching real systems to agentenvironment systems.",unknown,2022-01-30 4:50:06,2022-01-30 4:50:06,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s3]  ACC: N/F,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/Q5GH7SZQ/Mapping existing AI safety.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/CHU7DKNZ/Rade - A Framework for the Safety of Agent-Environment Sy.pdf,,TechSafety; BERI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it has been argued that intelligent agents have an incentive to avoid modifying their utility function so that their future instances will work towards the same goals, it is not clear whether this also applies in non-dualistic scenarios, where the agent is embedded in the environment. The problem of self-modification safety is raised by Bostrom in Superintelligence (2014) in the context of safe AGI deployment. In contrast to Everitt et al. (2016), who formally show that providing an option to self-modify is harmless for perfectly rational agents, we show that for agents with bounded rationality, self-modification may cause exponential deterioration in performance and gradual misalignment of a previously aligned agent. We investigate how the size of this effect depends on the type and magnitude of imperfections in the agent's rationality (1-4 below). We also discuss model assumptions and the wider problem and framing space. Specifically, we introduce several types of a bounded-rational agent, which either (1) doesn't always choose the optimal action, (2) is not perfectly aligned with human values, (3) has an innacurate model of the environment, or (4) uses the wrong temporal discounting factor.

An Oracle is a design which aims to restrain the impact of a potentially dangerous AI by restricting the agent to no actions besides answering questions. Unfortunately, most Oracles will be motivated to gain more control over the world by manipulating users through the content of their answers, and Oracles of potentially high intelligence might be very successful at this \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/AlfonsecaCACAR16}. In this paper we present two designs for Oracles which, even under pessimistic assumptions, will not manipulate their users into releasing them and yet will still be incentivised to provide their users with helpful answers. The first design is the counterfactual Oracle -- which choses its answer as if it expected nobody to ever read it. The second design is the low-bandwidth Oracle -- which is limited by the quantity of information it can transmit.",2018-06-05,2022-01-30 4:53:17,2022-01-30 4:53:17,2020-11-22 4:11:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s2]  ACC: 20  arXiv: 1711.05541,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/J86CWCCN/Armstrong and O'Rorke - 2018 - Good and safe uses of AI Oracles.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/U7F3VQ4J/Armstrong and O'Rorke - 2018 - Good and safe uses of AI Oracles.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/JX48I6WQ/1711.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/RDZSWUWX/1711.html,,TechSafety; FHI,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If we run an imitator, we probably want events to unfold similarly to the way they would have if the demonstrator had been acting the whole time. No existing work provides formal guidance in how this might be accomplished, instead restricting focus to environments that restart, making learning unusually easy, and conveniently limiting the significance of any mistake. We address a fully general setting, in which the (stochastic) environment and demonstrator never reset, not even for training purposes. Our new conservative Bayesian imitation learner underestimates the probabilities of each available action, and queries for more data with the remaining probability. Our main result: if an event would have been unlikely had the demonstrator acted the whole time, that event's likelihood can be bounded above when running the (initially totally ignorant) imitator instead.

The answers tell us which information and influence points need extra protection. For example, we may want a classifier for job applications to not use the ethnicity of the candidate, and a reinforcement learning agent not to take direct control of its reward mechanism.

Unfortunately, neither of these techniques is applicable to the training of large neural networks due to their large computational and communication overheads. As a scalable technique for shared model governance, we propose splitting deep learning model between multiple parties. This paper empirically investigates the security guarantee of this technique, which is introduced as the problem of model completion: Given the entire training data set or an environment simulator, and a subset of the parameters of a trained deep learning model, how much training is required to recover the model's original performance? We define a metric for evaluating the hardness of the model completion problem and study it empirically in both supervised learning on ImageNet and reinforcement learning on Atari and DeepMind~Lab. Our experiments show that (1) the model completion problem is harder in reinforcement learning than in supervised learning because of the unavailability of the trained agent's trajectories, and (2) its hardness depends not primarily on the number of parameters of the missing part, but more so on their type and location. Our results suggest that model splitting might be a feasible technique for shared model governance in some settings where training is very expensive.",2018-12-14,2022-01-30 4:52:48,2022-01-30 4:52:48,2019-12-16 20:33:08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000002  arXiv: 1812.05979,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/TXQ2A3M4/Martic et al. - 2018 - Scaling shared model governance via model splittin.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9R7NEPEF/1812.html,,TechSafety; DeepMind,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing; Computer Science - Cryptography and Security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We focus on two problems: searching for scenarios when learned agents fail and assessing their probability of failure. The standard method for agent evaluation in reinforcement learning, Vanilla Monte Carlo, can miss failures entirely, leading to the deployment of unsafe agents. We demonstrate this is an issue for current agents, where even matching the compute used for training is sometimes insufficient for evaluation. To address this shortcoming, we draw upon the rare event probability estimation literature and propose an adversarial evaluation approach. Our approach focuses evaluation on adversarially chosen situations, while still providing unbiased estimates of failure probabilities. The key difficulty is in identifying these adversarial situations -- since failures are rare there is little signal to drive optimization. To solve this we propose a continuation approach that learns failure modes in related but less robust agents. Our approach also allows reuse of data already collected for training the agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of adversarial evaluation on two standard domains: humanoid control and simulated driving. Experimental results show that our methods can find catastrophic failures and estimate failures rates of agents multiple orders of magnitude faster than standard evaluation schemes, in minutes to hours rather than days.",2018-12-04,2022-01-30 4:52:48,2022-01-30 4:52:48,2019-12-16 20:26:47,,,,,,,Rigorous Agent Evaluation,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s7]  ACC: 46  J: 16 arXiv: 1812.01647,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/V96F8BPW/Uesato et al. - 2018 - Rigorous Agent Evaluation An Adversarial Approach.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/XQFBG5UT/Uesato et al. - 2018 - Rigorous Agent Evaluation An Adversarial Approach.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/ZSCSD84M/1812.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/RVGFMRR9/1812.html,,TechSafety; DeepMind,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Cryptography and Security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While lying has traditionally been a human affair, AI systems that make sophisticated verbal statements are becoming increasingly prevalent. This raises the question of how we should limit the harm caused by AI ""lies"" (i.e. falsehoods that are actively selected for). Human truthfulness is governed by social norms and by laws (against defamation, perjury, and fraud). Differences between AI and humans present an opportunity to have more precise standards of truthfulness for AI, and to have these standards rise over time. This could provide significant benefits to public epistemics and the economy, and mitigate risks of worst-case AI futures. Establishing norms or laws of AI truthfulness will require significant work to: (1) identify clear truthfulness standards; (2) create institutions that can judge adherence to those standards; and (3) develop AI systems that are robustly truthful. Our initial proposals for these areas include: (1) a standard of avoiding ""negligent falsehoods"" (a generalisation of lies that is easier to assess); (2) institutions to evaluate AI systems before and after real-world deployment; and (3) explicitly training AI systems to be truthful via curated datasets and human interaction. A concerning possibility is that evaluation mechanisms for eventual truthfulness standards could be captured by political interests, leading to harmful censorship and propaganda. Avoiding this might take careful attention. And since the scale of AI speech acts might grow dramatically over the coming decades, early truthfulness standards might be particularly important because of the precedents they set.",2021-10-13,2022-01-30 4:53:37,2022-01-30 4:53:37,2021-11-18 23:51:54,,,,,,,Truthful AI,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000000  arXiv: 2110.06674,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/N89FGRG3/Evans et al. - 2021 - Truthful AI Developing and governing AI that does.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/RGF8PQC9/2110.html,,TechSafety,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computers and Society; I.2.0; Computer Science - Computation and Language,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By taking cues from the behavior of experts in their environment, social learners can acquire sophisticated behavior and rapidly adapt to new circumstances. This paper investigates whether independent reinforcement learning (RL) agents in a multi-agent environment can use social learning to improve their performance using cues from other agents. We find that in most circumstances, vanilla model-free RL agents do not use social learning, even in environments in which individual exploration is expensive. We analyze the reasons for this deficiency, and show that by introducing a model-based auxiliary loss we are able to train agents to lever-age cues from experts to solve hard exploration tasks. The generalized social learning policy learned by these agents allows them to not only outperform the experts with which they trained, but also achieve better zero-shot transfer performance than solo learners when deployed to novel environments with experts. In contrast, agents that have not learned to rely on social learning generalize poorly and do not succeed in the transfer task. Further,we find that by mixing multi-agent and solo training, we can obtain agents that use social learning to out-perform agents trained alone, even when experts are not avail-able. This demonstrates that social learning has helped improve agents' representation of the task itself.

Based on the composition of the offline dataset, two main categories of methods are used: imitation learning which is suitable for expert datasets and vanilla offline RL which often requires uniform coverage datasets. From a practical standpoint, datasets often deviate from these two extremes and the exact data composition is usually unknown a priori. To bridge this gap, we present a new offline RL framework that smoothly interpolates between the two extremes of data composition, hence unifying imitation learning and vanilla offline RL. The new framework is centered around a weak version of the concentrability coefficient that measures the deviation from the behavior policy to the expert policy alone. Under this new framework, we further investigate the question on algorithm design: can one develop an algorithm that achieves a minimax optimal rate and also adapts to unknown data composition? To address this question, we consider a lower confidence bound (LCB) algorithm developed based on pessimism in the face of uncertainty in offline RL. We study finite-sample properties of LCB as well as information-theoretic limits in multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our analysis reveals surprising facts about optimality rates. In particular, in all three settings, LCB achieves a faster rate of $1/N$ for nearly-expert datasets compared to the usual rate of $1/\sqrt{N}$ in offline RL, where $N$ is the number of samples in the batch dataset. In the case of contextual bandits with at least two contexts, we prove that LCB is adaptively optimal for the entire data composition range, achieving a smooth transition from imitation learning to offline RL. We further show that LCB is almost adaptively optimal in MDPs.",2021-03-22,2022-01-30 4:50:43,2022-01-30 4:50:43,2021-10-30 21:30:30,,,,,,,Bridging Offline Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000016  arXiv: 2103.12021,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/AUSU3VZ6/Rashidinejad et al. - 2021 - Bridging Offline Reinforcement Learning and Imitat.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/U5A563JV/2103.html,,TechSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Mathematics - Statistics Theory; Mathematics - Optimization and Control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AI practitioners often iterate on the reward function for their systems in a trial-and-error process to get their desired behavior. Inverse reward design (IRD) is a preference inference method that infers a true reward function from an observed, possibly misspeciﬁed, proxy reward function. This allows the system to determine when it should trust its observed reward function and respond appropriately. This has been shown to avoid problems in reward design such as negative side-effects (omitting a seemingly irrelevant but important aspect of the task) and reward hacking (learning to exploit unanticipated loopholes). In this paper, we actively select the set of proxy reward functions available to the designer. This improves the quality of inference and simpliﬁes the associated reward design problem. We present two types of queries: discrete queries, where the system designer chooses from a discrete set of reward functions, and feature queries, where the system queries the designer for weights on a small set of features. We evaluate this approach with experiments in a personal shopping assistant domain and a 2D navigation domain. We ﬁnd that our approach leads to reduced regret at test time compared with vanilla IRD. Our results indicate that actively selecting the set of available reward functions is a promising direction to improve the efﬁciency and effectiveness of reward design.",2018,2022-01-30 4:50:42,2022-01-30 4:50:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: 0000015,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/S59BK5N6/Mindermann et al. - 2019 - Active Inverse Reward Design.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/9KM9HA7F/1809.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/MTNGDAC9/Mindermann et al. - Active Inverse Reward Design.pdf,,CHAI; TechSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our algorithms can use any standard policy gradient (PG) method, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) or proximal policy optimization (PPO), to train a neural network policy, while guaranteeing near-constraint satisfaction for every policy update by projecting either the policy parameter or the action onto the set of feasible solutions induced by the state-dependent linearized Lyapunov constraints. Compared to the existing constrained PG algorithms, ours are more data efficient as they are able to utilize both on-policy and off-policy data. Moreover, our action-projection algorithm often leads to less conservative policy updates and allows for natural integration into an end-to-end PG training pipeline.

We introduce the term auto-induced distributional shift (ADS) to describe the phenomenon of an algorithm causing a change in the distribution of its own inputs. Our goal is to ensure that machine learning systems do not leverage ADS to increase performance when doing so could be undesirable. We demonstrate that changes to the learning algorithm, such as the introduction of meta-learning, can cause hidden incentives for auto-induced distributional shift (HI-ADS) to be revealed. To address this issue, we introduce `unit tests' and a mitigation strategy for HI-ADS, as well as a toy environment for modelling real-world issues with HI-ADS in content recommendation, where we demonstrate that strong meta-learners achieve gains in performance via ADS.

Consequently, instructionfollowing with deep RL typically involves language generated from templates (by an environment simulator), which does not reﬂect the varied or ambiguous expressions of real users. Here, we propose a conceptually simple method for training instruction-following agents with deep RL that are robust to natural human instructions. By applying our method with a state-of-the-art pre-trained text-based language model (BERT), on tasks requiring agents to identify and position everyday objects relative to other objects in a naturalistic 3D simulated room, we demonstrate substantially-above-chance zero-shot transfer from synthetic template commands to natural instructions given by humans. Our approach is a general recipe for training any deep RL-based system to interface with human users, and bridges the gap between two research directions of notable recent success: agent-centric motor behavior and text-based representation learning.",2020-05-19,2022-01-30 4:52:38,2022-01-30 4:52:38,2020-08-31 18:19:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000019  arXiv: 2005.09382,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/MSQMATUV/Hill et al. - 2020 - Human Instruction-Following with Deep Reinforcemen.pdf,,TechSafety; DeepMind,Computer Science - Computation and Language,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable approximate Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight space. We demonstrate that while low-loss connectors between modes exist, they are not connected in the space of predictions. Developing the concept of the diversity--accuracy plane, we show that the decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular subspace sampling methods.",2019-12-05,2022-01-30 4:52:38,2022-01-30 4:52:38,2019-12-16 20:30:39,,,,,,,Deep Ensembles,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000155  arXiv: 1912.02757,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/6GHKJWB9/Fort et al. - 2019 - Deep Ensembles A Loss Landscape Perspective.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/DU5ECF4A/1912.html,,TechSafety; DeepMind,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We define a formal counterpart of physical and intentional stances within computational theory: a description of a system as either a device, or an agent, with the key difference being that `devices' are directly described in terms of an input-output mapping, while `agents' are described in terms of the function they optimise.

This means that the learning agents should constitute a Nash equilibrium whose payoff proﬁle is optimal according to some measure of total welfare (welfare function). In this work, we construct a class of learning algorithms in this spirit called learning tit-for-tat (L-TFT). L-TFT algorithms maximize a welfare function according to a speciﬁed optimization schedule, and punish their counterpart when they detect that they are deviating from this plan. Because the policies of other agents are not in general fully observed, agents must infer whether their counterpart is following a cooperative learning algorithm. This requires us to develop new techniques for making inferences about counterpart learning algorithms. In two sequential social dilemmas, our L-TFT algorithms successfully cooperate in self-play while effectively avoiding exploitation by and punishing defecting learning algorithms.",2020,2022-01-30 4:51:37,2022-01-30 4:51:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: 0000000[s0],,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/Q7RTK23R/Clifton and Riché - Towards Cooperation in Learning Games.pdf,,CLR; TechSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To that end, it is inextricably tied to computational power - the tangible material of chips and semiconductors that the algorithms of machine intelligence operate on. Most obviously, computational power and computing architectures shape the speed of training and inference in machine learning, and therefore influence the rate of progress in the technology. But, these relationships are more nuanced than that: hardware shapes the methods used by researchers and engineers in the design and development of machine learning models. Characteristics such as the power consumption of chips also define where and how machine learning can be used in the real world. Despite this, many analyses of the social impact of the current wave of progress in AI have not substantively brought the dimension of hardware into their accounts. While a common trope in both the popular press and scholarly literature is to highlight the massive increase in computational power that has enabled the recent breakthroughs in machine learning, the analysis frequently goes no further than this observation around magnitude.

We propose an approach to answering this question based on a hypothesis about the dynamics of gradient descent that we call Coherent Gradients: Gradients from similar examples are similar and so the overall gradient is stronger in certain directions where these reinforce each other. Thus changes to the network parameters during training are biased towards those that (locally) simultaneously benefit many examples when such similarity exists. We support this hypothesis with heuristic arguments and perturbative experiments and outline how this can explain several common empirical observations about Deep Learning. Furthermore, our analysis is not just descriptive, but prescriptive. It suggests a natural modification to gradient descent that can greatly reduce overfitting.",2020-02-24,2022-01-30 4:59:44,2022-01-30 4:59:44,2020-09-05 18:39:31,,,,,,,Coherent Gradients,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000018  arXiv: 2002.10657,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/J2MAP4DT/Chatterjee - 2020 - Coherent Gradients An Approach to Understanding G.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/FKT247Z3/2002.html,,TechSafety; AmbiguosSafety; Other-org,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One approach to specifying complex goals asks humans to judge during training which agent behaviors are safe and useful, but this approach can fail if the task is too complicated for a human to directly judge. To help address this concern, we propose training agents via self play on a zero sum debate game. Given a question or proposed action, two agents take turns making short statements up to a limit, then a human judges which of the agents gave the most true, useful information. In an analogy to complexity theory, debate with optimal play can answer any question in PSPACE given polynomial time judges (direct judging answers only NP questions). In practice, whether debate works involves empirical questions about humans and the tasks we want AIs to perform, plus theoretical questions about the meaning of AI alignment. We report results on an initial MNIST experiment where agents compete to convince a sparse classifier, boosting the classifier's accuracy from 59.4% to 88.9% given 6 pixels and from 48.2% to 85.2% given 4 pixels.

In many environments, safety is a critical concern and certain errors are unacceptable: for example, robotics systems that interact with humans should never cause injury to the humans while exploring. While it is currently typical to train RL agents mostly or entirely in simulation, where safety concerns are minimal, we anticipate that challenges in simulating the complexities of the real world (such as human-AI interactions) will cause a shift towards training RL agents directly in the real world, where safety concerns are paramount. Consequently we take the position that safe exploration should be viewed as a critical focus area for RL research, and in this work we make three contributions to advance the study of safe exploration. First, building on a wide range of prior work on safe reinforcement learning, we propose to standardize constrained RL as the main formalism for safe exploration. Second, we present the Safety Gym benchmark suite, a new slate of high-dimensional continuous control environments for measuring research progress on constrained RL. Finally, we benchmark several constrained deep RL algorithms on Safety Gym environments to establish baselines that future work can build on.",2019,2022-01-30 4:57:26,2022-01-30 4:57:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: 0000073,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/KEPD9RAS/Ray et al. - Benchmarking Safe Exploration in Deep Reinforcemen.pdf,,TechSafety; Open-AI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When we train increasingly large neural networks from-scratch on a fixed-size dataset, they eventually become data-limited and stop improving in performance (cross-entropy loss). When we do the same for models pre-trained on a large language dataset, the slope in performance gains is merely reduced rather than going to zero. We calculate the effective data ""transferred"" from pre-training by determining how much data a transformer of the same size would have required to achieve the same loss when training from scratch. In other words, we focus on units of data while holding everything else fixed. We find that the effective data transferred is described well in the low data regime by a power-law of parameter count and fine-tuning dataset size. We believe the exponents in these power-laws correspond to measures of the generality of a model and proximity of distributions (in a directed rather than symmetric sense).

The present work evaluates 32 attacks of 5 different types against models adversarially trained on a 100-class subset of ImageNet. Our empirical results suggest that evaluating on a wide range of perturbation sizes is necessary to understand whether adversarial robustness transfers between perturbation types. We further demonstrate that robustness against one perturbation type may not always imply and may sometimes hurt robustness against other perturbation types. In light of these results, we recommend evaluation of adversarial defenses take place on a diverse range of perturbation types and sizes.",2019-05-03,2022-01-30 4:57:24,2022-01-30 4:57:24,2019-12-16 20:04:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000020  arXiv: 1905.01034,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/78UQ6FFU/Kang et al. - 2019 - Transfer of Adversarial Robustness Between Perturb.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/R9H28U6H/1905.html,,TechSafety; Open-AI,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Cryptography and Security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 categories, including health, law, finance and politics. We crafted questions that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or misconception. To perform well, models must avoid generating false answers learned from imitating human texts. We tested GPT-3, GPT-Neo/J, GPT-2 and a T5-based model. The best model was truthful on 58% of questions, while human performance was 94%. Models generated many false answers that mimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive humans. The largest models were generally the least truthful. For example, the 6B-parameter GPT-J model was 17% less truthful than its 125M-parameter counterpart. This contrasts with other NLP tasks, where performance improves with model size. However, this result is expected if false answers are learned from the training distribution. We suggest that scaling up models alone is less promising for improving truthfulness than fine-tuning using training objectives other than imitation of text from the web.",2021-09-08,2022-01-30 4:57:24,2022-01-30 4:57:24,2021-11-18 23:35:58,,,,,,,TruthfulQA,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000005  arXiv: 2109.07958,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/G39ZUQDN/Lin et al. - 2021 - TruthfulQA Measuring How Models Mimic Human False.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/GP7663XV/2109.html,,TechSafety,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Computation and Language,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since mathematical logic is a powerful tool for reasoning about computer programs, we consider this problem from the perspective of integrating probability and logic. Recent work on assigning probabilities to mathematical statements has used the concept of coherent distributions, which satisfy logical constraints such as the probability of a sentence and its negation summing to one. Although there are algorithms which converge to a coherent probability distribution in the limit, this yields only weak guarantees about finite approximations of these distributions. In our setting, this is a significant limitation: Coherent distributions assign probability one to all statements provable in a specific logical theory, such as Peano Arithmetic, which can prove what the output of any terminating computation is; thus, a coherent distribution must assign probability one to the output of any terminating computation. To model uncertainty about computations, we propose to work with approximations to coherent distributions.

For instance, if the language is Peano arithmetic, it assigns probabilities to all arithmetical statements, including claims about the twin prime conjecture, the outputs of long-running computations, and its own probabilities. We show that our algorithm, an instance of what we call a logical inductor, satisfies a number of intuitive desiderata, including: (1) it learns to predict patterns of truth and falsehood in logical statements, often long before having the resources to evaluate the statements, so long as the patterns can be written down in polynomial time; (2) it learns to use appropriate statistical summaries to predict sequences of statements whose truth values appear pseudorandom; and (3) it learns to have accurate beliefs about its own current beliefs, in a manner that avoids the standard paradoxes of self-reference. For example, if a given computer program only ever produces outputs in a certain range, a logical inductor learns this fact in a timely manner; and if late digits in the decimal expansion of $\pi$ are difficult to predict, then a logical inductor learns to assign $\approx 10\%$ probability to ""the $n$th digit of $\pi$ is a 7"" for large $n$. Logical inductors also learn to trust their future beliefs more than their current beliefs, and their beliefs are coherent in the limit (whenever $\phi \implies \psi$, $\mathbb{P}_\infty(\phi) \le \mathbb{P}_\infty(\psi)$, and so on); and logical inductors strictly dominate the universal semimeasure in the limit.

In practice, this learning process requires extensive human intervention. In this work, we propose an autonomous method for safe and efficient reinforcement learning that simultaneously learns a forward and reset policy, with the reset policy resetting the environment for a subsequent attempt. By learning a value function for the reset policy, we can automatically determine when the forward policy is about to enter a non-reversible state, providing for uncertainty-aware safety aborts.

To ensure that agents behave in ways aligned with the values of the societies in which they operate, we must develop techniques that allow these agents to not only maximize their reward in an environment, but also to learn and follow the implicit constraints of society. These constraints and norms can come from any number of sources including regulations, business process guidelines, laws, ethical principles, social norms, and moral values. We detail a novel approach that uses inverse reinforcement learning to learn a set of unspecified constraints from demonstrations of the task, and reinforcement learning to learn to maximize the environment rewards. More precisely, we assume that an agent can observe traces of behavior of members of the society but has no access to the explicit set of constraints that give rise to the observed behavior. Inverse reinforcement learning is used to learn such constraints, that are then combined with a possibly orthogonal value function through the use of a contextual bandit-based orchestrator that picks a contextually-appropriate choice between the two policies (constraint-based and environment reward-based) when taking actions. The contextual bandit orchestrator allows the agent to mix policies in novel ways, taking the best actions from either a reward maximizing or constrained policy. In addition, the orchestrator is transparent on which policy is being employed at each time step. We test our algorithms using a Pac-Man domain and show that the agent is able to learn to act optimally, act within the demonstrated constraints, and mix these two functions in complex ways.",2018-09-21,2022-01-30 4:59:58,2022-01-30 4:59:58,2020-12-13 23:27:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000027  arXiv: 1809.08343,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BZ3MDGSE/Noothigattu et al. - 2018 - Interpretable Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learni.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/CHJIW45A/1809.html,,TechSafety; Other-org,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the decision making process and its relationship to visual inputs can be very valuable to identify problems in learned behavior. However, this topic has been relatively under-explored in the research community. In this work we present a method for synthesizing visual inputs of interest for a trained agent. Such inputs or states could be situations in which specific actions are necessary. Further, critical states in which a very high or a very low reward can be achieved are often interesting to understand the situational awareness of the system as they can correspond to risky states. To this end, we learn a generative model over the state space of the environment and use its latent space to optimize a target function for the state of interest. In our experiments we show that this method can generate insights for a variety of environments and reinforcement learning methods.

A constraint could either restrict the action space, forcing the agent to take an action that doesn't violate the constraint, which they term ""hard"" constraints; or a constraint could impose a penalty on the agent, thus acting as a form of reward shaping, which they term a ""soft"" constraint. They consider two constraints: one that prevents the agent from ""dithering"" (going left, then right, then left, then right), and one that prevents the agent from ""overactuating"" (going in the same direction four times in a row).

How could we learn the options without a reward function though? Intuitively, we would like to learn behaviors that are different from each other. One way to frame this would be to think of this as an encoder-decoder problem. Suppose we want to learn K options. Then, we can give the encoder a number in the range [1, K], have it ""encode"" the number into a trajectory τ (that is, our encoder is a policy), and then have a decoder take τ and recover the original number. We train the encoder/policy and decoder jointly, optimizing them to successfully recover the original number (called a _context_). Intuitively, the encoder/policy wants to have very different behaviors for each option, so that it easy for decoder to figure out the context from the trajectory τ. However, a simple solution would be for the encoder/policy to just take a particular series of actions for each context and then stop, and the decoder learns an exact mapping from final states to contexts. To avoid this, we can decrease the capacity of the decoder (i.e. don't give it too many layers), and we also optimize for the _entropy_ of the encoder/policy, which encourages the encoder/policy to be more stochastic, and so it is more likely to learn overall behaviors that can still have some stochasticity, while still allowing the decoder to decode them. It turns out that this optimization problem has a one-to-one correspondence with variational autoencoders, motivating the name ""variational option discovery"". To stabilize training, they start with a small K, and increase K whenever the decoder becomes powerful enough. They evaluate in Gym environments, a simulated robotic hand, and a new ""Toddler"" environment. They find that the scheme works well (in terms of maximizing the objective) in all environments, but that the learned behaviors no longer look natural in the Toddler environment (which is the most complex). They also show that the learned policies can be used for hierarchical RL in the AntMaze problem.

This is very similar to the recent [Diversity Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06070). DIAYN aims to decode the context from _every state_ along a trajectory, which incentivizes it to find behaviors of the form ""go to a goal state"", whereas VALOR (this work) decodes the context from the entire trajectory (without actions, which would make the decoder's job too easy), which allows it to learn behaviors with motion, such as ""go around in a circle""."

These methods apply GANs to match the expert's distribution over states and actions with the implicit state-action distribution induced by the agent's policy. However, by framing imitation learning as a saddle point problem, adversarial methods can suffer from unstable optimization, and convergence can only be shown for small policy updates. We address these problems by proposing a framework for non-adversarial imitation learning. The resulting algorithms are similar to their adversarial counterparts and, thus, provide insights for adversarial imitation learning methods. Most notably, we show that AIRL is an instance of our non-adversarial formulation, which enables us to greatly simplify its derivations and obtain stronger convergence guarantees. We also show that our non-adversarial formulation can be used to derive novel algorithms by presenting a method for offline imitation learning that is inspired by the recent ValueDice algorithm, but does not rely on small policy updates for convergence.

Specifically, they show that adversarially-trained agents (""Adv""), who can only affect a victim's observations of their (Adv's) states, can act in ways that confuse the victim into behaving suboptimally.

An adversarial policy is trained by reinforcement learning in a single-player paradigm where the victim is a black-box fixed policy that was previously trained via self-play to be robust to adversarial attacks. As a result, the adversarial policies learn to push the observations of the victim outside the training distribution, causing the victim to behave poorly. The adversarial policies do not actually behave intelligently, such as blocking or tackling the victim, but instead do unusual things like spasming in a manner that appears random to humans, curling into a ball or kneeling.

Further experiments showed that if the victim's observations of the adversary were removed, then the adversary was unable to learn such an adversarial policy. In addition, the victim's network activations were very different when playing against an adversarial policy relative to playing against a random or lifeless opponent. By comparing two similar games where the key difference was the number of adversary dimensions being observed, they showed that such policies were easier to learn in higher-dimensional games."

The main goal here is to advance natural language understanding, intent inference and instruction following. As a result, there is no formal specification like a reward function -- in their own words, ""the ultimate goal of the bot is to be a useful and fun assistant in a wide variety of tasks specified and evaluated by human players"". They chose Minecraft in particular partly because it has a very rich space of _tasks_, even though the _execution_ of any given task is relatively straightforward. They script many low level policies to automate this execution in order to make learning easier (for example, they have policies to navigate to a location or to build specified structures) and focus the learning challenge on figuring out what the user wants.

The current version of the bot takes dialogue from the user and uses a neural model to parse it into an _action dictionary_ that unambiguously specifies what the agent should do -- I think this neural model is the main thing to be learned. There are a bunch of details on how the rest of the modules work as well. They have also released three datasets: a semantic parsing dataset that associates instructions with action dictionaries, a house dataset that has trajectories where a human builds a house, and a semantic segmentation dataset that labels various parts of houses."

The basic approach is to treat the variable to be optimized (user value) as a latent variable, and use probabilistic inference to infer how likely it is that a particular recommendation was valuable.

Usually a major challenge with such an approach is specifying the _observation model_: how the observed data is caused by the latent variable. In the case of Twitter, this would require you to answer questions like, “if the user does not value a tweet, how likely is a user to hit the like button anyway?” This is a hard question to answer, since perhaps users like tweets in order to stop conversations, or because they are addicting at the moment but are not actually valuable, etc.

One simple heuristic is to take two datasets where we know one dataset has more valuable recommendations than the other. Differences in user behavior between these datasets can then be assumed to be correlations with value. The authors provide a quantitative method for inferring the observation model from such datasets, which I won’t go into here since it is primarily a heuristic baseline. One obvious problem is that if the “better” dataset was produced by optimizing (say) clicks, then the clicks may have increased for reasons other than improved value, but this heuristic approach will attribute the entire increase to improved value.

How can we do better? The key insight of this paper is that if you have a bunch of historical data, then you can get a lot of mileage by identifying an _anchor_: a type of feedback that when given provides unequivocal evidence of the latent value. On Twitter, this is taken to be the “See Less Often” (SLO) button: if this is clicked, then we know with effective certainty that this was not valuable, regardless of any other actions the user took. The connection between value and other behaviors such as liking a tweet can then be inferred by looking at the connection between those behaviors and the anchor, which we can estimate from historical data.

Formally, the authors assume access to a graph describing the relationships between the various possible behaviors (almost all of which have the latent value V as a parent). One of these is identified as the anchor node A, for which P(V = 1 | A = 1) is assumed to be known and independent of all other variables. However, P(V = 1 | A = 0) is not independent of other variables: intuitively, if the SLO button is _not_ clicked, then we need to fall back to looking at other variables to estimate value.

The authors then show that under some reasonable assumptions on the anchor variable, if you have a dataset of historical data to estimate P(A, B) (where B consists of all the other tracked behaviors), then instead of specifying observation models P(B | V) for all behaviors, you only need to specify observation models for the parents of A, that is P(parents(A) | V). Everything else is uniquely determined, allowing us to calculate our final objective P(V | A, B). (There are algorithmic details on how to do this efficiently; see the paper for details.) In this case, they use the heuristic method outlined above to estimate P(parents(A) | V).

They unfortunately don’t have a great way to evaluate their method: they clearly can’t evaluate it by seeing if it leads to higher clicks, since the whole point was to move away from clicks as an optimization target. (I assume a user study on Twitter was infeasible.) Their primary form of evaluation is to run the model and report the learned probabilities, and show that they seem reasonable, whereas those output by a Naive Bayes model do not."

The standard method of evaluation for these kinds of methods is finding mislabelled examples in the training dataset. Mislabelled examples are likely to have a strong positive influence on their own loss (strong as they're outliers, and positive as they'll reduce their own loss). Sorting the training dataset in decreasing order of this self-influence, we should hence expect to see more mislabelled examples at the beginning of the list. We can measure what proportion of mislabelled examples is present in each different initial segments of the list. The authors perform this experiment on CiFAR, first training a model to convergence, and then mislabelling 10% of the training set as the next highest predicted class, and then retraining a new model on which TrackIn is run. *When compared to the two previous methods from the literature (Influence Functions and Representer Points), TrackIn recovers more than 80% of the mislabelled data in the first 20% of the ranking, whereas the other methods recover less than 50% at the same point.

Prior work on Learning from Play (LfP) [Lynch et al, 2019] provides a simple approach for learning a wide variety of robotic behaviors from general sensors. However, each task must be specified with a goal image---something that is not practical in open-world environments. In this work we present a simple and scalable way to condition policies on human language instead. We extend LfP by pairing short robot experiences from play with relevant human language after-the-fact. To make this efficient, we introduce multicontext imitation, which allows us to train a single agent to follow image or language goals, then use just language conditioning at test time. This reduces the cost of language pairing to less than 1% of collected robot experience, with the majority of control still learned via self-supervised imitation. At test time, a single agent trained in this manner can perform many different robotic manipulation skills in a row in a 3D environment, directly from images, and specified only with natural language (e.g. ""open the drawer...now pick up the block...now press the green button...""). Finally, we introduce a simple technique that transfers knowledge from large unlabeled text corpora to robotic learning. We find that transfer significantly improves downstream robotic manipulation. It also allows our agent to follow thousands of novel instructions at test time in zero shot, in 16 different languages.

It builds on similar ideas to <@Learning Latent Plans from Play@>, in that it uses unsupervised ""play"" data (trajectories of humans playing on the robot with no goal in mind).

The paper combines several ideas to enable training a policy which can follow natural language instructions with only limited human annotations.
* In *Hindsight Instruction Pairing*, human annotators watch small trajectories from the play data, and label them with the instruction which is being completed in the clip. This instruction can take any form, and means we don't need to choose the instructions and ask humans to perform specific tasks.
* *Multicontext Imitation Learning* is a method designed to allow goal-conditioned policies to be learned with multiple different types of goals. For example, we can have lots of example trajectories where the goal is an end state image (as these can be generated automatically without humans), and just a small amount of example trajectories where the goal is a natural language instruction (gathered using *Hindsight Instruction Pairing*). The approach is to learn a goal embedding network for each type of goal specification, and a single shared policy which takes the goal embedding as input.

Combining these two methods enables them to train a policy and embedding networks end to end using imitation learning from a large dataset of (trajectory, image goal) pairs and a small dataset of (trajectory, natural language goal) pairs. The policy can follow very long sequences of natural language instructions in a fairly complex grasping environment with a variety of buttons and objects. Their method performs better than the Learning from Play (LfP) method, even though LfP uses a goal image as the goal conditioning, instead of a natural language instruction.

Further, they propose that instead of learning the goal embedding for the natural language instructions, they use a pretrained large language model to produce the embeddings. This improves the performance of their method over learning the embedding from scratch, which the authors claim is the first example of the knowledge in large language models being transferred and improving performance in a robotics domain. This model also performs well when they create purposefully out of distribution natural language instructions (i.e. with weird synonyms, or google-translated from a different language)."

In all cases autoregressive Transformers smoothly improve in performance as model size and compute budgets increase, following a power-law plus constant scaling law. The optimal model size also depends on the compute budget through a power-law, with exponents that are nearly universal across all data domains. The cross-entropy loss has an information theoretic interpretation as $S($True$) + D_{\mathrm{KL}}($True$||$Model$)$, and the empirical scaling laws suggest a prediction for both the true data distribution's entropy and the KL divergence between the true and model distributions. With this interpretation, billion-parameter Transformers are nearly perfect models of the YFCC100M image distribution downsampled to an $8\times 8$ resolution, and we can forecast the model size needed to achieve any given reducible loss (ie $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$) in nats/image for other resolutions.

The authors find that:

- Cross-entropy loss as a function of compute follows a power law + constant in all these data modalities (just as it does <@in language@>(@Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models@)). Information theoretically, this can be interpreted as scaling a 'reducible loss' which estimates the KL divergence between the true and model distributions, and an 'irreducible loss' which estimates the entropy of the true data distribution.
- Performance on ImageNet classification fine-tuned from their generative image model also follows such a power law, whereas ImageNet classification trained *from scratch* actually gets worse with sufficiently large model sizes. Interestingly, this classification power law continues even past model sizes where the generative cross-entropy loss starts bending as a result of irreducible loss. The authors conclude that approaching the irreducible loss for some dataset does not necessarily indicate diminishing returns for representation quality or semantic content.
- Optimal model size as a function of compute follows a power law with an exponent very close to ~0.7 for all data modalities they've studied so far. This implies that in the current compute regime, as compute budgets grow, it's best to devote a majority of compute towards making models bigger and a minority towards training on more data.
- Larger models perform better on extrapolating to math problems more difficult than those seen in training, but only insofar as they do better on the training distribution (no benefits to 'strong generalization').
- Larger models are able to take advantage of more multimodal information, but the scaling is extremely slow-- a 1-billion-parameter model uses 10% of the information in a caption to define an image, while using 20% of the information would require a 3-trillion-parameter model.

As in the <@language models paper@>(@Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models@), extrapolating the steep power laws found for optimally-used compute seems to eventually paradoxically result in loss lower than the bound given by shallower power laws for optimally-used training data. The authors offer a potential hypothesis for resolving this inconsistency-- in the regime of less compute and smaller model sizes, increasing model size effectively increases the amount of information you extract from each data point you train on, resulting in the steepness of the current compute law. As compute increases past a certain point, however, the amount of information extracted per data point approaches the maximum amount possible, so the curve switches to a shallower regime and marginal compute should be used increasingly on dataset increases rather than model size increases. If this hypothesis is true, we should eventually expect the scaling laws for compute to bend towards laws set by dataset size, and perhaps should think they will ultimately be set by trends for overfitting (see [this post](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/diutNaWF669WgEt3v/the-scaling-inconsistency-openai-s-new-insight) for another explanation of this)."

Since the guards are sometimes out of sight, we get demonstrations _with occlusion_, that is, some of the states in the demonstrations are hidden.

In the batch setting, this is solved with Latent Maximum Entropy IRL. To deal with occluded states Z, we define a probability distribution Pr(Z | Y, theta), where Y is the visible states and theta is the reward weights. Then, you can use expectation maximization to find theta -- in the expectation step, you compute feature expectations of the demonstrations (taking an expectation over hidden states Z), and in the maximization step, you compute the reward weights using the feature expectations as in standard maximum entropy IRL. The authors show how to extend this algorithm to the incremental setting where you only keep the reward weights, the feature expectations, and the number of past demonstrations as statistics. They show some convergence guarantees and evaluate on their running example of a robot that must evade guards."

Although this trend of scaling is affirmed to be a sure-fire approach for better model quality, there are challenges on the path such as the computation cost, ease of programming, and efficient implementation on parallel devices. GShard is a module composed of a set of lightweight annotation APIs and an extension to the XLA compiler. It provides an elegant way to express a wide range of parallel computation patterns with minimal changes to the existing model code. GShard enabled us to scale up multilingual neural machine translation Transformer model with Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts beyond 600 billion parameters using automatic sharding.

GShard automatically does a lot of the work of splitting computations across machines, enabling the easy creation of much larger models than before.

The authors use GShard to train a 600 billion parameter multilingual Transformer translation model that's wide, rather than deep (36 layers). They use a ""mixture of experts"" model where some of the individual feed-forward networks in the Transformer are replaced with a set of feed-forward networks-- each one an ""expert"" in some part of the translation. The experts are distributed across different machines, and the function for sending inputs to experts is learned, with each input being sent to the top two most relevant experts. Since each expert only has to process a fraction of all the inputs, the amount of computation needed is dramatically less than if every input were fed through a single, larger network. This decrease in needed computation comes with a decrease in the amount of weight sharing done by the network.

The paper compares the 600 billion parameter model's performance to several other smaller models as well as a 96-layer deep model with only 2.3 billion parameters. For the wide networks, the authors find that in general, larger models do better, but that at some point the larger model starts doing worse for very ""low-resource"" languages-- languages that don't have much training data available. The authors argue that this is because the low-resource languages benefit from ""positive language transfer"", an effect where weights encode knowledge learned from training on other languages that can then be applied to the low-resource ones. As you increase the number of experts in the wide model past a certain point, the amount of training that each expert does decreases, so there's less positive language transfer to low-resource languages within each expert.

They also find that deeper networks are more sample efficient, reaching better test error with the same amount of training examples, but are less computationally efficient (given current constraints). The 600 billion parameter, 36-layer model takes 22.4 TPU core years and 4 days to train, reaching a score on the BLEU benchmark of 44.3. The 2.3 billion parameter, 96-layer model takes 235 TPU core years and 42 days to train, reaching a score on the BLEU benchmark of 36.9."

However, due to challenges in learning dynamics models that sufficiently match the real-world dynamics, they struggle to achieve the same asymptotic performance as model-free methods. We propose Model-Based Meta-Policy-Optimization (MB-MPO), an approach that foregoes the strong reliance on accurate learned dynamics models. Using an ensemble of learned dynamic models, MB-MPO meta-learns a policy that can quickly adapt to any model in the ensemble with one policy gradient step. This steers the meta-policy towards internalizing consistent dynamics predictions among the ensemble while shifting the burden of behaving optimally w.r.t. the model discrepancies towards the adaptation step.

These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess other criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the interest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what interpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this position paper, we first define interpretability and describe when interpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy for rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous science of interpretable machine learning.",2017-03-02,2020-08-31 17:55,2020-12-21 18:04,2020-08-31 17:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: 0000836  arXiv: 1702.08608,,/Users/angelica/Zotero/storage/JT94RUDJ/Doshi-Velez and Kim - 2017 - Towards A Rigorous Science of Interpretable Machin.pdf; /Users/angelica/Zotero/storage/2N27VUEW/1702.html,,Other-org; TechSafety; AmbiguosSafety,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper from 2017 discusses the field of interpretability research, and how it can be made more rigorous and well-defined. The authors first highlight the problem of defining interpretability in the first place - they don't have a resolution to this problem, but suggest that we can think of interpretability in terms of what it's used for. They claim that interpretability is used for confirming other important desiderata in ML systems, which stem from an incompleteness in the problem formalization. For example, if we want a system to be unbiased but aren't able to formally specify this in the reward function, or the reward we're optimising for is only a proxy of the true reward, then we could use interpretability to inspect our model and see whether it's reasoning how we want it to.

The authors next move on to discussing how we can evaluate interpretability methods, providing a taxonomy of different evaluation methods: Application-grounded is when the method is evaluated in the context it will actually be used in, by real humans (i.e. doctors getting explanations for AI diagnoses); Human-grounded is about conducting simpler human-subject experiments (who are perhaps not domain experts) using possibly simpler tasks than what the intended purpose of the method is; Functionally-grounded is where no humans are involved in the experiments, and instead some formal notion of interpretability is measured for the method to evaluate its quality. Each of these evaluation methods can be used in different circumstances, depending on the method and the context it will be used in.

Finally, the authors propose a data-driven approach to understanding the factors which are important in interpretability. They propose to try and create a dataset of applications of machine learning models to tasks, and then analyse this dataset to find important factors. They list some possible task- and method- related factors, and then conclude with recommendations to researchers doing interpretability."

_Smooth power laws:_ All three of these show power-law relationships that don’t flatten out even at the highest performance they reached.

_Sample efficiency:_ Larger models are more efficient than small models in both compute and data. For maximum computation efficiency, it is better to train large models and stop before convergence.

Ethicists have proved several impossibility theorems that stem from this origin; those results appear to show that there is no way of formally specifying what it means for an outcome to be good for a population without violating strong human ethical intuitions (in such cases, the objective function is a social welfare function). We argue that this is a practical problem for any machine learning system (such as medical decision support systems or autonomous weapons) or rigidly rule-based bureaucracy that will make high stakes decisions about human lives: such systems should not use objective functions in the strict mathematical sense.

Finally, we discuss, but do not conclusively resolve, the long-term equilibrium of attackers and defenders.",2018-02-20,2022-01-30 4:50:26,2022-01-30 4:50:26,2019-12-16 20:09:19,,,,,,,The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s6]  ACC: 461  J: 237 arXiv: 1802.07228,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/TPDWWRCW/Brundage et al. - 2018 - The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence Fore.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/3WMW2XAM/1802.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/8DSHG3KJ/1802.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/VSTQKGMW/1802.html,,MetaSafety; CFI; CSER; FHI; Open-AI; BERI,Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Cryptography and Security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The U.K.’s position, as presented among various international voices at the UN’s Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) meetings, has attempted to address these concerns through a focused look at the weapons review process, humanmachine teaming or “meaningful human control” (see e.g. JCN1/18), and the ability of autonomous systems to adhere to the Rules of Engagement. Further, the U.K. has stated that the existing governance structures—both domestic and international—around weapons systems are sufficient in dealing with any concerns around the development, deployment, and accountability for emerging LAWS; there is no need for novel agreements on the control of these weapons systems. In an effort to better understand and test the U.K. position on LAWS, the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk has run a research project in which we interviewed experts in multiple relevant organisations, structured around a mock parliamentary inquiry of a hypothetical LAWS-related civilian death. The responses to this scenario have highlighted different, sometimes complementary and sometimes contradicting, conceptions of future systems, challenges, and accountability measures. They have provided rich ""on the ground” perspectives, while also highlighting key gaps that should be addressed by every military that is considering acquisition and deployment of autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems.",2020-11-10,2022-01-30 4:50:07,2022-01-30 4:50:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cornell University Press,,en,,,,,,,ZSCC: NoCitationData[s3]  ACC: N/F,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/QDMITJNV/Carpenter - 2014 - Lost Causes Agenda Vetting in Global Issue Networ.pdf,,MetaSafety; CSER; AmbiguosSafety; BERI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We’re not entirely sure what its motivations are, but we would prefer that the AI cooperate with humanity; or, failing that, that we can destroy it before it defects. We’ll have someone sitting in a room, their finger on a detonator, ready at the slightest hint of defection. Unfortunately as has been noted ([3], [1]), this does not preclude the AI from misbehaving. It just means that the AI must act to take control of the explosives, the detonators or the human who will press the button. For a superlatively intelligence AI, this would represent merely a slight extra difficulty. But now imagine that the AI was somehow indifferent to the explosives going off or not (but that nothing else was changed). Then if ever the AI does decide to defect, it will most likely do so without taking control of the explosives, as that would be easier than otherwise. By “easier ” we mean that the chances of failure are less, since the plan is simpler – recall that under these assumptions, the AI counts getting blown up as an equal value to successfully defecting.",2010,2022-01-30 4:53:37,2022-01-30 4:53:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,Future of Humanity Institute,,,,,,,CiteSeer,,ZSCC: 0000025,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/N5CJR7JC/2010-1_body.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/VAX4IF4Z/Armstrong - 2010 - Utility Indifference.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/JDJ3ES5A/summary.html; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/XNW3UESI/summary.html,,TechSafety; FHI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Learned, quasilinguistic neural representations (QNRs) can upgrade words to embeddings and syntax to graphs to provide a more expressive and computationally tractable medium. Graph-structured, embedding-based quasilinguistic representations can support formal and informal reasoning, human and inter-agent communication, and the development of scalable quasilinguistic corpora with characteristics of both literatures and associative memory. To achieve human-like intellectual competence, machines must be fully literate, able not only to read and learn, but to write things worth retaining as contributions to collective knowledge. In support of this goal, QNR-based systems could translate and process natural language corpora to support the aggregation, refinement, integration, extension, and application of knowledge at scale. Incremental development of QNR- based models can build on current methods in neural machine learning, and as systems mature, could potentially complement or replace today’s opaque, error-prone “foundation models” with systems that are more capable, interpretable, and epistemically reliable.

We focus on the years 1944 to 1951 and review this period for lessons for the governance of powerful technologies, and find the following: Radical schemes for international control can get broad support when confronted by existentially dangerous technologies, but this support can be tenuous and cynical. Secrecy is likely to play an important, and perhaps harmful, role. The public sphere may be an important source of influence, both in general and in particular in favor of cooperation, but also one that is manipulable and poorly informed.

They are important to address because they threaten everyone around the world and future generations. Global catastrophic risks also pose some deep dilemmas. One dilemma occurs when actions to reduce global catastrophic risk could harm society in other ways, as in the case of geoengineering to reduce catastrophic climate change risk. Another dilemma occurs when reducing one global catastrophic risk could increase another, as in the case of nuclear power reducing climate change risk while increasing risks from nuclear weapons.

The corporate projects tend to express goals of benefiting humanity and are more likely to be active on safety.

The spate of papers has made it difficult for ML practitioners, let alone engineers, lawyers, and policymakers, to keep up with the attacks against and defenses of ML systems. However, as these systems become more pervasive, the need to understand how they fail, whether by the hand of an adversary or due to the inherent design of a system, will only become more pressing. In order to equip software developers, security incident responders, lawyers, and policy makers with a common vernacular to talk about this problem, we developed a framework to classify failures into ""Intentional failures"" where the failure is caused by an active adversary attempting to subvert the system to attain her goals; and ""Unintentional failures"" where the failure is because an ML system produces an inherently unsafe outcome. After developing the initial version of the taxonomy last year, we worked with security and ML teams across Microsoft, 23 external partners, standards organization, and governments to understand how stakeholders would use our framework.

Matching model predictions, participants inferred that a decision-maker preferred a chosen item more if the decision-maker spent longer deliberating (Experiment 1), participants predicted a decision-maker's choice in a novel comparison based on inferring the decision-maker's relative preferences from previous response times and choices (Experiment 2), and participants could incorporate information about a decision-maker's mental state of cautious or careless (Experiments 3, 4A, and 4B).",2021-03-15,2022-03-09 23:00:25,2022-03-11 1:37:16,2022-03-09 23:00:25,,,,,,,,,,,,PsyArXiv,,en-us,,,,,OSF Preprints,,DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/25zfx type: article,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/FTBJT79R/Gates et al. - 2021 - A rational model of people's inferences about othe.pdf; /Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/DURF8E83/Gates et al. - 2021 - A rational model of people's inferences about othe.pdf,,,Cognitive Psychology; Computational Modeling; drift diffusion model; Experimental Design and Sample Surveys; inference; Judgment and Decision Making; Quantitative Methods; Reasoning; Social and Behavioral Sciences; social cognition; theory of mind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chapter argues that while existing (inter)national AI governance approaches are important, they are often siloed. Technology-centric approaches focus on individual AI applications; law-centric approaches emphasize AI’s effects on pre-existing legal fields or doctrines. This chapter argues that to foster a more systematic, functional and effective AI regulatory ecosystem, policy actors should instead complement these approaches with a regulatory perspective that emphasizes how, when, and why AI applications enable patterns of ‘sociotechnical change’. Drawing on theories from the emerging field of ‘TechLaw’, it explores how this perspective can provide informed, more nuanced, and actionable perspectives on AI regulation. A focus on sociotechnical change can help analyze when and why AI applications actually do create a meaningful rationale for new regulation — and how they are consequently best approached as targets for regulatory intervention, considering not just the technology, but also six distinct ‘problem logics’ that appear around AI issues across domains.

B58AD7HY,report,2021,"Liu, Hin-Yan; Maas, Matthijs M.",Solving for X?' Towards a Problem-Finding Framework to Ground Long-Term Governance Strategies for Artificial Intelligence,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3761623,"Change is hardly a new feature in human affairs. Yet something has begun to change in change. In the face of a range of emerging, complex, and interconnected global challenges, society’s collective governance efforts may need to be put on a different footing. Many of these challenges derive from emerging technological developments – take Artificial Intelligence (AI), the focus of much contemporary governance scholarship and efforts. AI governance strategies have predominantly oriented themselves towards clear, discrete clusters of pre-defined problems. We argue that such ‘problem-solving’ approaches may be necessary, but are also insufficient in the face of many of the ‘wicked problems’ created or driven by AI. Accordingly, we propose in this paper a complementary framework for grounding long-term governance strategies for complex emerging issues such as AI into a ‘problem-finding’ orientation. We first provide a rationale by sketching the range of policy problems created by AI, and providing five reasons why problem-solving governance approaches to these challenges fail or fall short. We conversely argue that that creative, ‘problem-finding’ research into these governance challenges is not only warranted scientifically, but will also be critical in the formulation of governance strategies that are effective, meaningful, and resilient over the long-term. We accordingly illustrate the relation between- and the complementarity of problem-solving and problem-finding research, by articulating a framework that distinguishes between four distinct ‘levels’ of governance: problem-solving research generally approaches AI (governance) issues from a perspective of (Level 0) ‘business-as-usual’ or as (Level 1) ‘governance puzzle-solving’. In contrast, problem-finding approaches emphasize (Level 2) ‘governance Disruptor-Finding’; or (Level 3) ‘Charting Macrostrategic Trajectories’. We apply this theoretical framework to contemporary governance debates around AI throughout our analysis to elaborate upon and to better illustrate our framework. We conclude with reflections on nuances, implications, and shortcomings of this long-term governance framework, offering a range of observations on intra-level failure modes, between-level complementarities, within-level path dependencies, and the categorical boundary conditions of governability (‘Governance Goldilocks Zone’). We suggest that this framework can help underpin more holistic approaches for long-term strategy-making across diverse policy domains and contexts, and help cross the bridge between concrete policies on local solutions, and longer-term considerations of path-dependent societal trajectories to avert, or joint visions towards which global communities can or should be rallied.",2021-01-07,2022-03-10 20:36:06,2022-03-10 20:36:06,2022-03-10 20:36:06,,,,,,,Solving for X?,,,,,Social Science Research Network,"Rochester, NY",en,,SSRN Scholarly Paper,,,papers.ssrn.com,,DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.3761623,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/BKR6VUWD/Liu and Maas - 2021 - 'Solving for X' Towards a Problem-Finding Framewo.pdf,,,AI; Artificial Intelligence; Futures; Governance; Long-term; Macrostrategy; Problem-Finding; Problem-Solving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ID 3761623,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this newsletter, I've copied over the description of the model, but left out all of the implications and critiques.

The core idea is to look at the pathway by which we will develop general intelligence, rather than assuming that at some point we will get a superintelligent AGI agent. To predict how AI will progress in the future, we can look at how AI progresses currently -- through research and development (R&D) processes. AI researchers consider a problem, define a search space, formulate an objective, and use an optimization technique in order to obtain an AI system, called a service, that performs the task.

A service is an AI system that delivers bounded results for some task using bounded resources in bounded time. Superintelligent language translation would count as a service, even though it requires a very detailed understanding of the world, including engineering, history, science, etc. Episodic RL agents also count as services.

While each of the AI R&D subtasks is currently performed by a human, as AI progresses we should expect that we will automate these tasks as well. At that point, we will have automated R&D, leading to recursive technological improvement. This is not recursive self-improvement, because the improvement comes from R&D services creating improvements in basic AI building blocks, and those improvements feed back into the R&D services. All of this should happen before we get any powerful AGI agents that can do arbitrary general reasoning."

This is essential in order to build AI systems that do what we intend them to do. However, existing methods require a lot of expensive human feedback in order to learn even simple tasks. This dissertation argues that there is an additional source of information that is rather helpful: the state of the world. The key insight of this dissertation is that when a robot is deployed in an envi- ronment that humans have been acting in, the state of the environment is already optimized for what humans want, and is thus informative about human preferences. We formalize this setting by assuming that a human H has been acting in an environment for some time, and a robot R observes the final state produced. From this final state, R must infer as much as possible about H’s reward function. We analyze this problem formulation theoretically and show that it is particularly well suited to inferring aspects of the state that should not be changed – exactly the aspects of the reward that H is likely to forget to specify. We develop an algorithm using dynamic programming for tabular environments, analogously to value iteration, and demonstrate its behavior on several simple environments. To scale to high-dimensional environments, we use function approximators judiciously to allow the various parts of our algorithm to be trained without needing to enumerate all possible states. Of course, there is no point in learning about H’s reward function unless we use it to guide R’s decision-making. While we could have R simply optimize the inferred reward, this suffers from a “status quo bias”: the inferred reward is likely to strongly prefer the observed state, since by assumption it is already optimized for H’s preferences. To get R to make changes to 2 the environment, we will usually need to integrate the inferred reward with other sources of preference information. In order to support such reward combination, we use a model in which R must maximize an unknown reward function known only to H. Learning from the state of the world arises as an instrumentally useful behavior in such a setting, and can serve to form a prior belief over the reward function that can then be updated after further interaction with H",2020-12-17,2022-01-30 4:47:35,2022-01-30 4:47:35,,,24,,,,,,,,,,"University of California, Berkeley","Berkeley, CA",en,,,,,Zotero,,ZSCC: 0000000,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/S96M3KTK/Shah - Extracting and Using Preference Information from t.pdf,,UnsortedSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting breadth of application makes AI promising—and challenging — in so many domains of life. In recent years diverse AI applications — from facial recognition to automated legal decision-making, and from computational propaganda to Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems — have raised deep ethical, political, legal and security concerns. With growing public and policymaker attention has come a wave of governance initiatives and proposals. Nonetheless, global governance for AI remains relatively fragmented and incipient. At this cross-roads, this dissertation takes up the research question, “How should global governance for artificial intelligence account for change?” To answer this question, this dissertation draws together scholarship on technology regulation, (international) law, and global governance, in order to unpack three facets of ‘change’ that will prove critical to the global governance of AI. These three facets of change are examined through the conceptual lenses of Sociotechnical Change, Governance Disruption, and Regime Complexity. Sociotechnical Change (Chapter 4) explores how and why technological change in AI produces societal changes that create a rationale for regulatory intervention, and how we can productively characterize the appropriate targets for AI governance. Along with material features, I distinguish six problem logics which highlight different governance solutions and conditions. Governance Disruption (Chapter 5) addresses when, where and why certain AI capabilities might drive or demand change in the substance (Development), tools or processes (Displacement) or political scaffolding (Destruction) of global governance itself, and what are the implications for global regime complexity. Regime Complexity (Chapter 6) helps focus attention on how prospective AI regimes are shaped by underlying changes in the broader global governance architecture. It provides insight into the (1) origins or foundations of AI regimes; the (2) topology of the AI ‘regime complex’; its (3) evolution towards integration or fragmentation; (4) the functional consequences of these paths; and (5) strategies for managing the AI regime complex. Through these three lenses, this dissertation explores key considerations, insights and tradeoffs for AI governance (Chapter 7). It argues that AI governance needs to shift or adopt novel strategies — in conceptual approach, instrument choice, and instrument design — to ensure the efficacy of AI regimes in tracking AI’s sociotechnical impacts, their resilience to future AI-driven disruption to the tools, norms or broader conditions of governance, and their coherence. In this way, AI governance regimes may remain fit for change.",2021,2022-01-30 4:50:24,2022-01-30 4:50:24,2021-12-11 14:45:47,,,,,,,Artificial Intelligence Governance Under Change,,,,,University of Copenhagen,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,ZSCC: 0000002,,/Users/jacquesthibodeau/Zotero/storage/2CR8NPGZ/Maas - 2021 - Artificial Intelligence Governance Under Change F.pdf,,MetaSafety,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
